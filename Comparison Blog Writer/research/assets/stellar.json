The Stellar protocol is supported by the nonprofit Stellar Development Foundation, founded in 2014. The for-profit arm, Lightyear.io, was established in 2017.\n\n**Ecosystem**\n\nStellar has an active community ecosystem and supports projects that utilize the Stellar Network through the Stellar Community Fund.\n\n**Overview**\n\nStellar is an open-source protocol for exchanging money or tokens using the Stellar Consensus Protocol. The platform's source code is hosted on GitHub. Servers run a software implementation of the protocol and use the Internet to connect to and communicate with other Stellar servers. Each server stores a ledger of all the accounts in the network. Transactions among accounts occur not through mining but rather through a consensus process among accounts in a quorum slice.\n\n**History**\n\nIn 2014, Jed McCaleb, founder of Mt. Gox and co-founder of Ripple, launched the Stellar network with former lawyer Joyce Kim. Before the official launch, McCaleb formed a website called \"Secret Bitcoin Project\" seeking alpha testers. The nonprofit Stellar Development Foundation was created in collaboration with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison, and the project officially launched that July. Stellar received $3 million in seed funding from Stripe. At its launch, the network had 100 billion stellars, with 25% allocated to other non-profits working toward financial inclusion. Stripe received 2% or 2 billion of the initial stellar in return for its seed investment. The cryptocurrency, originally known as stellar, was later called Lumens or XLM.\n\nIn August 2014, Mercado Bitcoin, the first Brazilian bitcoin exchange, announced it would be using the Stellar network. By January 2015, Stellar had approximately 3 million registered user accounts on its platform, and its market cap was almost $15 million.\n\nThe Stellar Development Foundation released an upgraded protocol with a new consensus algorithm in April 2015, which went live in November 2015. The new algorithm used SCP, a cryptocurrency protocol created by Stanford professor David Mazi\u00e8res.\n\nLightyear.io, a for-profit entity of Stellar, was launched in May 2017 as the commercial arm of the company. In September 2017, Stellar announced a benefits program, part of its Stellar Partnership Grant Program, which would award partners up to $2 million worth of Lumens for project development. In September 2018, Lightyear Corporation acquired Chain, Inc., and the combined company was named Interstellar.\n\nIn 2021, Franklin Templeton launched the first tokenized US mutual fund using Stellar.\n\n**Usage**\n\nIn 2015, it was announced that Stellar was releasing an integration into Vumi, the open-sourced messaging platform of the Praekelt Foundation in South Africa. Vumi uses cellphone talk time as currency using the Stellar protocol. Stellar partnered with cloud-based banking software company Oradian in April 2015 to integrate Stellar into Oradian's banking platform to add microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Nigeria.\n\nDeloitte announced its integration with Stellar in 2016 to build a cross-border payments application, Deloitte Digital Bank. In December 2016, it was announced that Stellar's payment network had expanded to include Coins.ph, a mobile payments startup in the Philippines; ICICI Bank in India; African mobile payments firm Flutterwave; and French remittances company Tempo Money Transfer.\n\nIn October 2017, Stellar partnered with IBM and KlickEx to facilitate cross-border transactions in the South Pacific region. The cross-border payment system developed by IBM includes partnerships with banks in the area. The Lumens digital currency was ranked 13th in market capitalization at the time of the IBM partnership.\n\nIn December 2017, TechCrunch announced Stellar's partnership with SureRemit, a Nigerian-based remittances platform.\n\nOn January 6, 2021, the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine announced cooperation and partnership with Stellar in the development of Ukraine's digital infrastructure.\n\n### Source 2: Is Stellar As Secure As You Think? - https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13302\n\nStellar is one of the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization. It adopts a variant of Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), named federated Byzantine agreement (FBA), which generalizes the traditional BFT algorithm to make it more suitable for open-membership blockchains. To this end, FBA introduces a quorum slice concept, which consists of a set of nodes. In FBA, a node can complete one consensus round when it receives specific messages from nodes in a quorum slice appointed by the node.\n\nIn this study, we analyze FBA, whose security is highly dependent on the structure of quorum slices, and demonstrate that it is not superior to the traditional BFT algorithm in terms of safety and liveness. Then, to analyze the security of the Stellar consensus protocol (SCP), which is a construction for FBA, we investigate the current quorum slices in Stellar. We analyze the structure of quorum slices and measure the influence of each node quantitatively using two metrics, PageRank (PR) and the newly proposed NodeRank (NR). The results show that the Stellar system is significantly centralized. Thereafter, to determine how the centralized structure can have a negative impact on the Stellar system, we study the cascading failure caused by deleting only a few nodes (i.e., validators) in Stellar. We show that all of the nodes in Stellar cannot run SCP if only two nodes fail. To make matters worse, these two nodes are run and controlled by a single organization, the Stellar foundation.\n\n### Source 3: Stellar - https://www.stellar.org\n\nStellar is an open-source network for currencies and payments.
