We are upgrading for network efficiency and engaging validators for open development. As the blockchain industry expands, Harmony is now incubating use cases in generative AI and platform primitives.\n\n**Year of Efficiency**\n\nThe core team and the community are proposing Harmony Improvement Proposal 30:\n\n- Dynamic sharding: Change from 4 shards to 2 shards, and from 1000 nodes to 450 nodes.\n- Fast finality: Optimize from 2 seconds to 1 second finality as a new industry benchmark.\n- Validator fellows: Re-engage active validators and launch new delegator campaigns.\n\n**Decentralized Finance Primitives**\n\nHarmony continues to build the foundation for developers with Ethereum tools including:\n\n- Uniswap v3 fork: This deploy will provide pools of concentrated liquidity through community governance on listings and fees.\n- 1USD stablecoin: This Liquity-fork with optimized parameters will serve as native utility and token reserve.\n- Emission DAO: This community-driven governance will accelerate asset recovery and ecosystem growth.\n\n**Platform Focus**\n\nWith Harmony's mainnet in production for 4 years, our upcoming initiatives including:\n\n1. Protocol: Network developments on state sync, account abstraction, 1-second finality, and validator fellows.\n2. Ecosystem: Decentralized Finance such as Uniswap v3 and stablecoin, as well as social wallets and community market makers.\n3. Labs: Domain NFTs 1.country, creator profiles, Telegram bots and Web3 spreadsheets.\n\n**AI Meets Web3**\n\nHarmony's strategy of adoption in generative AI and machine learning include:\n\n- Onchain Payments: Token metering and shared accounts to increase user access.\n- Market Pricing: Smart contracts and radical auctions to discover supply-demand dynamics.\n- Zero-knowledge Proofs: Cryptography and blockchain security to enforce data privacy.\n\n**Horizon Bridge Recovery**\n\nSince the Horizon Bridge security breach, we have been working with partners and agencies including The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) who concluded that the Lazarus Group Cyber Actors as the responsible party. The recovery effort is progressing consistently with clearing the depegged assets with active participation of the community. A bridge has since been launched with the LayerZero protocol that allows asset bridging between Harmony and Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Arbitrum.\n\n**Open Development**\n\nHarmony is deploying new decentralized finance primitives and generative AI use cases. With our commitment to network efficiency, user adoption, developer integrations, Harmony will continue in our journey to scale trust and create a sustainable ecosystem.\n\nAbout Harmony\n\nHarmony is an open and fast blockchain. Our mainnet runs Ethereum applications with 2-second transaction finality and 100 times lower fees. We are an open platform for your assets, collectibles, identity and governance. Follow us on Twitter or Substack.\n\n### Source 2: Harmony 2023: Uniform Scaling & Onchain Security - https://open.harmony.one/harmony-2023\n\nHarmony is a scalable and secure blockchain. Our mainnet is live with state sharding since 2019 June and with open staking since 2020 May. Harmony achieves 2-second transaction finality with 4 shards, 250 nodes each, 25.3K onchain delegators, 60% liveness slashing, and sub-second leader rotations.\n\nToward 2023, we are developing 1-block composable cross-shard transactions; validator resharding every 18-hour epoch with gradual state sync; and, account abstractions for smart wallets with social recovery but no central custodians or fee forwarders.\n\nFirstly, Harmony supports uniform scaling, meaning that our shards grow linearly and boundlessly with transaction demands. Our nodes, states, transactions are each cleanly divided into shards with secure synchronization with the beacon shard.\n\nSecondly, Harmony supports onchain security, meaning that our delegators, bridges, wallets minimize trust assumptions besides malicious validators. Our end-to-end security relies only on the core protocol and smart contract execution \u2013 without risking censorship from colluded entities, suffering any single point of backend failure, sidestepping storage of authentication credentials, or leaking identifiable information.\n\nAt peak, Harmony\u2019s protocol achieved 500 transactions per shard per second in production, our elastic endpoints served 800M requests per day \u2013 with our network accruing $1.41B total value locked, $1.48B stakes, 162 validator pools, 120 active apps, 75 DAO governors, 371K monthly active users, and 656K total wallets.\n\nHarmony is Ethereum-compatible and supports 1. DeFi (Aave, Curve, Frax, Sushi, Tranquil, Stably, StakeDAO); 2. games (DeFi Kingdom, DeFira, Mercury Forge); 3. NFT (Bored Apes, Animoca, Atari, MAD, .country domains), 4. DAOs (Gnosis, Snapspot, Aragon); 5. middleware (Chainlink, Graph, Covalent, DappRader, Pocket Networks, Chainsafe, Hummingbot); 6. bridges (LayerZero, Datachain, Celer, Trustless BTC); 7. gateways (Wyre, Transak, MoonPay, Simplex); 8. exchanges (Binance, Huobi, Kucoin, Crypto.com, OKX); and, 9. wallets (Metamask, Ledger, Trust, 1Wallet).\n\nIn 2023, besides protocol development mentioned above, Harmony is driving adoption via games (desktop-mobile wallet sync, tournament escrows, embedded marketplaces) \u2013 as well as impact via community (social curation, creator-fan economy, seasonal governance) and cross-chain ",
