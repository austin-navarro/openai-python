With this API, clients can query content indices, retrieve files, deploy entities, and download periodic snapshots.\n\n**Lambda Service**\n\nThe lambda service, provided by all Catalysts, offers a set of utility endpoints that allow clients to retrieve and validate commonly required data. Some of the endpoints require access to blockchain state to verify the ownership of referenced assets. In these cases, The Graph is used to query the blockchain.\n\n**Comms Service**\n\nThe archipelago service, provided by all Catalysts, groups players into dynamic clusters called islands, defined by proximity. It automatically balances the number of players on each island and reassigns them as they travel the world to enable efficient peer-to-peer communications (such as text and voice chat).\n\n**Backend for Frontend Service (BFF)**\n\nThis service was created to resolve client needs to enable faster development of new features without breaking the existing APIs. In the Catalyst context, it\u2019s used for the communications between peers connected to the client; its main responsibility is to manage the P2P signaling.\n\n**World Explorer**\n\nThe World Explorer is the iconic client of the Decentraland protocol, an application for players to enter the metaverse, explore it, and enjoy the experiences created by others.\n\nSubsystems:\n\n- **Content system**\n- **Game engine**\n- **Scene runtime**\n- **Comms system**\n\n**Content System**\n\nThe client-side counterpart to the content service of the Catalyst network. It downloads and caches content files and can update assets such as a player\u2019s profile on behalf of the user.\n\n**Game Engine**\n\nThe graphics rendering and interactive functions of the World Explorer are provided by a game engine, such as Unity.\n\nSubsystems:\n\n- **Rendering system**\n- **State system**\n- **Input system**\n\n**Rendering System**\n\nThis subsystem receives instructions from scenes running in the World Explorer and renders the 3D environment. Each World Explorer implements this system using the capabilities of the chosen game engine.\n\n**State System**\n\nThe game engine gives life to all entities and components created across scenes, synchronizing a globally maintained state with the individually handled state of each scene.\n\n**Input System**\n\nThe input system handles user interaction, such as the player\u2019s keyboard, mouse, or controller. Events are then routed to the components that subscribed to them, including interactive entities and UI displays.\n\n### Source 2: Decentraland - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentraland\n\nDecentraland is a 3D virtual world browser-based platform. Users may buy virtual plots of land in the platform as NFTs via the MANA cryptocurrency, which uses the Ethereum blockchain. Designers can create and sell clothes and accessories for the avatars to be used in the virtual world.\n\nIt was opened to the public in February 2020 and is overseen by the nonprofit Decentraland Foundation. In 2017, the platform raised $26 million in its initial coin offering (ICO); by 2022, indy100 reported that it had a $1.2 billion market evaluation. While DappRadar found that as few as 38 users performed currency transactions in a single day, Decentraland claimed that 8,000 people per day used the platform in 2022.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, major brands appeared in Decentraland or bought \"properties\" in it. These include Samsung, Adidas, Atari, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Miller Lite. Sotheby's held its first metaverse auction, and in March 2022, Decentraland hosted Metaverse Fashion Week in which major fashion brands appeared, including Dolce & Gabbana, Tommy Hilfiger, Elie Saab, Nicholas Kirkwood, Perry Ellis, Imitation of Christ, and Est\u00e9e Lauder. Music artists including Deadmau5 and Grimes held concerts in the platform.\n\nIn October 2022, indy100 reported that Decentraland had a market valuation of $1.2 billion.\n\nIn October 2022, the DappRadar tracking site reported that the Decentraland platform was seeing fewer than 1,000 users performing currency transactions on the site each day, with one particular 24-hour period having only 38 such users. Decentraland later claimed that \"active users\" were only users that had unique blockchain wallet addresses that interact with its system, and that users that did not have wallet addresses weren't counted.\n\n### Source 3: Decentraland Launches Revamped Virtual World with Enhanced Performance, Engaging Features, and Future-Ready Architecture - https://theblockchain.digital/decentraland-launches-revamped-virtual-world-with-enhanced-performance-engaging-features-and-future-ready-architecture/\n\nDecentraland, the first decentralized virtual social world, launched a powerful new desktop client today, signaling a new era for experiencing spatial environments. This beta release enhances performance, delivers a more immersive environment, and introduces new engaging features, setting the stage for future innovations and expanded creator tools.\n\nThis milestone marks the shift away from a browser-based experience, replaced by a more stable, Unity-powered desktop client and the new ",
