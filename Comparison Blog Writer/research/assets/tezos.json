It provides Tezos with the ability to tap into EVM-compatible ecosystems like Arbitrum and Optimism.\n- Tezos currently has 288 active validators and 167.8K delegators, securing nearly $566.55 million in total economic security at current prices.\n- From Q2 to Q3 2024, TVL fell close to 26% in USD terms. However, in terms of total XTZ locked, the metric was up 27%.\n- The Tezos X roadmap outlines some major future goals: introduction of the Michelson rollups, adding support for mainstream programming languages including JavaScript, launch of the canonical rollup and the vision to hit 1 million TPS with a block time of 5 seconds.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nTezos (XTZ) is a Layer 1 smart contract blockchain network that powers a range of applications including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and gaming. It was founded by Arthur Breitman (former research engineer at GoogleX and quantitative analyst at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley) along with his wife Kathleen Breitman (who holds a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Economics from Cornell University). At the time of writing, Tezos is ranked #81 with a market capitalisation of $1.07 billion according to CoinMarketCap. The project enjoys a strong community with over 444K followers on Twitter, 8K members in its official Telegram group and more than 72.3K members on Reddit.\n\n**History**\n\nIn 2015, the Breitmans established a company called Dynamic Ledger Solutions (DLS), which was responsible for writing the initial code for Tezos. DLS held the intellectual property rights to the Tezos codebase prior to the network\u2019s launch. As part of the Tezos project, DLS agreed to transfer these rights to the Tezos Foundation in exchange for a percentage of the total initial token supply. This agreement allowed the Tezos Foundation to oversee the blockchain\u2019s further development while ensuring that DLS was rewarded for its contribution to the project.\n\n**Token Generation**\n\nTezos raised $232 million in its fundraiser with key contributors including Polychain Capital, Draper Associates, Winklevoss Capital, Boost VC, TrustVC and Hashchain Capital. Of the initial token supply, 79.59% was allocated to ICO participants, 0.41% to early backers and contributors, 10% to the Tezos Foundation, and 10% to Dynamic Ledger Solutions. The total initial supply of XTZ during the fundraiser was approximately 763 million tokens.\n\n**Staking and Security**\n\nThe network currently has 288 active validators and 167.8K delegators, securing over 659 million XTZ in total value staked which translates to $566.55 million in total economic security at current prices. It has a staking market cap ratio of 66.26% and is ranked #26 by staking market cap according to Staking Rewards. At the time of writing, Tezos validators are earning an annualised reward rate of 16.2% on their stake. The annual inflation rate for XTZ is currently 5.82%. The real yield earned by validators is therefore equal to 10.38%.\n\n**Architecture and Previous Upgrades**\n\n**Consensus**\n\nTezos operates using a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. In Tezos, validators are known as \u201cbakers\u201d and are responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks. To become a baker, a participant needs to hold a minimum of 6,000 XTZ. Bakers are selected to validate blocks based on the size of their stake \u2013 either their own or those delegated to them. Delegation allows token holders who do not wish to bake themselves to assign their XTZ to a baker without transferring ownership, giving them a share of the rewards. This liquid delegation system is flexible because participants can easily re-delegate their tokens to other bakers if they wish, promoting decentralization and encouraging active participation in securing the network. (The consensus is therefore also referred to as Liquid Proof-of-Stake.)\n\nBakers are rewarded with new XTZ for successfully creating blocks but they are also penalized through slashing if they act maliciously. This mechanism creates incentives for bakers to maintain the network\u2019s integrity.\n\n**Tezos Shell and Protocol Architecture**\n\nTezos\u2019 architecture is divided into two key components: the Shell and the Protocol.\n\n**Shell:** The Shell is the intermediary layer between the blockchain and the protocol. It is responsible for managing communication between network nodes, updating the chain state and determining the head block based on consensus. The head block is the most recent block that has been validated and added to the blockchain. It represents the current state of the ledger, including all confirmed transactions up to that point.\n\nIt manages the blockchain\u2019s self-amendment process by determining which version of the protocol to apply when upgrades are proposed and voted upon.\n\n**Protocol:** The Protocol layer consists of the blockchain\u2019s rules and logic. Tezos is designed to be self-amending, meaning that upgrades can be proposed, voted on and implemented on-chain through governance without needing a hard fork. The self-amendment process reduces the likelihood of contentious splits in the community and ensures smooth transitions as the network evolves (on-chain governance unlike some projects that do it off-chain).\n\nXTZ holders vote on proposals in a four-stage process: proposal, exploration vote, testing, and promotion vote. This governance model allows Tezos to adapt and upgrade over time in a decentralized way, which is key to its long-term sustainability.\n\n**Client/Server Architecture**\n\nTezos operates on a decentralized client-server architecture where different types of nodes contribute to maintaining the network. The architecture is composed of:\n\n**Full nodes:** These nodes store the entire blockchain history, validate new transactions, and propagate them across the network. Full nodes are crucial for decentralization and security, as they participate in validating the correctness of the blockchain.\n\n**Light clients:** Light clients only store a portion of the blockchain data and rely on full ",
