Its core technological stack includes an asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerant (aBFT) consensus mechanism known as Lachesis, and an EVM-compatible state machine called Opera. Fantom uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) aBFT consensus mechanism known as Lachesis. Lachesis provides security to Fantom's EVM-compatible smart contract chain called Opera. Because Fantom nodes reach consensus independently, each node verifies transactions asynchronously and is not required to incorporate other blocks sequentially\u2014this speeds up transaction execution and finality. Currently, the Fantom network operates with sub-second finality (~900 ms). Tokenholders that delegate stake receive native FTM rewards proportional to the amount delegated minus the 15% delegation fee charged by the validator. Fantom validators can be penalized and have their entire stake plus delegated FTM slashed in the event of a \u201cfork event.\u201d Fork events are created when a validator does not use its previous event block as the parent for its newest event block. Once slashed, the validator is no longer included in the active set of validators. Fantom plans to introduce network improvements this fall, such as a new StateDB storage system, Fantom Virtual Machine (FVM), and account abstraction. Project Carmen aims to implement a new storage system for Fantom. Currently, Fantom uses a key-value storage system that results in slower access times. Project Carmen seeks to address this by decreasing access times through a file-based StateDB. Project Tosca aims to implement a new upgrade to update Fantom\u2019s EVM with the Fantom Virtual Machine (FVM). The FVM is similar to its current EVM, as both are compatible with Solidity and Vyper, but the FVM offers improvements that should increase the speed of execution on Fantom. The FVM uses dynamic translation, which allows code related to smart contracts to be translated into a more efficient instruction format. Dynamic translation also enables multiple instructions to be merged into one \u201csuper-instruction,\u201d decreasing the number of executions needed. The Fantom Foundation is attempting to alleviate issues related to wallet management by introducing account abstraction on its mainnet. Through this initiative, Fantom improves upon the current account infrastructure on EVM networks by enhancing the application experience and enabling social recovery options for wallets. These features will be achieved by no longer distinguishing between EOA accounts and contracts for wallets. Instead, every wallet will become a smart contract. As a result, EOAs can be authorized to interact with smart contract wallets, allowing users to interact with their wallets using something as simple as an email and password.

Fantom is a fast, scalable, and secure Layer-1 platform compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine. In January 2021, we implemented on-chain governance in Fantom\u2019s fWallet. Fantom is the first layer-1 network to enable all users to make and vote on improvement proposals in a fully decentralized manner. In June 2021, the community voted to reduce the required FTM to run a validator node to 1,000,000 FTM. The requirements to become a validator are less stringent, and we expect to push the network decentralization significantly. In April 2021, we rolled out the Go-Opera upgrade. The major network upgrade reduced Time-to-Finality to one second on average and accelerated P2P synchronization, among several other technical improvements. Fantom\u2019s network activity stems from an ecosystem of DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces and projects, gaming applications, and more. The drivers of Fantom\u2019s network activity also include its growth strategy to attract developers and grow its ecosystem. One of Fantom\u2019s notable initiatives for 2023 is its Gas Monetization program. This program aims to reward high-quality applications and offer a sustainable income for developers with a portion of the transaction fees they generate for the network. Since its inception, the Gas Monetization program has accrued ~118,000 FTM as rewards for protocols. Alongside the Gas Monetization program, Fantom plans on incentivizing builders and developers through its Ecosystem Vault. In Q4 2022, the Fantom Foundation launched the Ecosystem Vault, introducing a decentralized funding process to support ecosystem builders. With the initiative, one-third of the 30% transaction fee burn rate (at the time) would be redirected to a Special Fee Contract (SFC). Through onchain governance, validators can allocate funds from the SFC. As of writing, the Ecosystem Vault had amassed ~750,000 FTM, with no funding proposals yet approved. However, at the end of June 2023, the Fantom Foundation introduced a new governance proposal to expedite the distribution of these funds using the Gitcoin Grants program. The first round of funding for Fantom projects began in early 2023, with Fantom Foundation as the matching partner.

The platform\u2019s architecture is designed to handle a significant number of transactions per second, meeting the demands of an increasingly decentralized digital economy. Key to Fantom\u2019s scalability is its ability to separate transactions across multiple chains, ensuring that network congestion is minimized. This approach allows for faster processing times and maintains high throughput even during peak usage. Among the specific scalability features are:\n\n- Asynchronous transaction processing ",
