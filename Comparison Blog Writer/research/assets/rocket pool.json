Rocket Pool is designed to provide the community with more autonomy, transparency and revenue.\n\n**Core Technology**\n\nRocket Pool\u2019s core technologies include the following:\n\n(1) Smart Contracts: Rocket Pool uses a series of smart contracts to manage functions such as pledge nodes, pledge pools, reward allocation, and liquidity token issuance.\n\n(2) Pledge Nodes: Rocket Pool allows anyone to run a pledge node by providing only 16 ETH as collateral and the remaining 16 ETH will be provided by the Pledge Pool. Pledge nodes can receive pledge rewards and service fees, while bearing the risk of pledging.\n\n(3) Pledge Pool: Rocket Pool allows anyone to participate in the pledge by depositing ETH into the Pledge Pool without the need to run a node or lock funds.\n\n**Security and Audit**\n\nRocket Pool\u2019s security is as follows:\n\n(1) Code Audit: Rocket Pool\u2019s smart contract code has passed several rounds of professional audits, including audits conducted by well-known security firms such as ConsenSys Diligence, Sigma Prime, Quantstamp, and others. The audit reports have all been made public and can be viewed on Rocket Pool\u2019s official website.\n\n(2) Pledge Insurance: Rocket Pool provides a pledge insurance mechanism for users in the pledge pool, i.e., if a pledged node is penalized for bad behavior, the collateral of the node will be used to compensate users in the pledge pool, so that the users will not lose the principal due to the node\u2019s failure.\n\n(3) Governance mechanism: Rocket Pool uses a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to manage the parameters and upgrades of the protocol, which avoids a single point of failure or malicious operation, and at the same time allows the community to participate in the decision-making and improvement of the protocol.\n\n**Competitive Advantages**\n\nCompared to projects like Lido, StakeWise, Ankr and others in the same track, Rocket Pool has several advantages:\n\n(1) Lower Pledge Threshold: Rocket Pool allows users to participate in pledging with a minimum threshold of 16 ETH, whereas all other products require at least 32 ETH. This allows more users to have the opportunity to participate in Ether 2.0 pledging without the need to accumulate a large amount of capital or delegate it to a third party.\n\n(2) Higher degree of decentralization: Rocket Pool is a fully decentralized pledge protocol that does not rely on any centralized operator or node provider. Anyone can run a pledge node or deposit into a pledge pool without the need to trust or delegate to any third party. Rocket Pool also uses a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to manage the protocol\u2019s parameters and upgrades, giving the community full governance rights.\n\n(3) Stronger Liquidity Guarantee: Rocket Pool provides users with a liquid token, rETH, which can be exchanged back to ETH at any time and can also be traded freely on the market. This allows users not to lose liquidity during the pledge period, and to buy and sell according to market conditions. Rocket Pool has also partnered with Synthetix to develop a synthetic asset, sETH, based on rETH, which can be used in Synthetix\u2019s ecosystem.\n\n(4) More incentives: Rocket Pool uses RPL tokens to incentivize pledge nodes and users in the pledge pool to provide better service and performance. rPL tokens can be used not only as a governance right, but also as a source of additional revenue for nodes and users, and the RPL tokens can also be used to measure the value and development of the protocol.\n\n### Source 2: Understanding Rocket Pool: A Comprehensive Overview - https://messari.io/report/understanding-rocket-pool-a-comprehensive-overview\n\n**Key Insights**\n\n- Rocket Pool is positioned in the Ethereum staking marketplace as a decentralized and user-friendly product with a clever alignment mechanism between stakers and validators.\n- Rocket Pool has experienced the greatest percent growth since The Merge out of any liquid staking derivative (LSD), entrenching its position as a legit contender for LSD dominance.\n- With the Redstone Upgrade complete, Rocket Pool is focused on ensuring rETH liquidity through strategic partnerships, executing their scalability roadmap, and internal operational structures (such as the Incentives Management Committee) to streamline DeFi adoption.\n- Rocket Pool\u2019s user base looks primed to grow, especially as the scalability roadmap continues to offer new products and services for ETH stakers, including less ETH bonded minipools (LEBs), staking-as-a-service (SaaS), and solo staker migration.\n\n**Rocket Pool Protocol**\n\nThe Rocket Pool protocol serves two primary user groups: users who wish to participate in ETH staking and users who want to stake ETH and run a node. Ethereum proof-of-stake requires 32 ETH to run a validator on the Ethereum Beacon Chain. Rocket Pool provides a unique solution by pairing smart node operators (supply side) with prospective ETH stakers (demand side). This relationship enables node operators and stakers to collaborate and achieve the 32 ETH threshold together.\n\n**Smart Node Operators (SNOs)**\n\nAny party holding 16 ETH can operate as an SNO by running a Rocket Pool Minipool Validator. To do so, the party must provide 16 ETH and stake at least 10% of the validator\u2019s ETH value in RPL, the protocol's governance token, as a security promise to Rocket Pool. In exchange, Rocket Pool aggregates and assigns 16 ETH in user-deposited ETH to the Minipool Validator. Smart node operators receive three forms of compensation:\n\n- RPL Rewards: Node operators are eligible for RPL rewards, funded via RPL\u2019s 5% emissions rate. RPL rewards are weighted by the proportion of total effective RPL posted as collateral.\n- Commission Rate: Node operators receive a 15% commission from stakers whose ETH is added to their minipool.\n- Staking Rewards: Node operators can collect commission-free staking rewards for any ETH they have staked themselves.\n\nSince the Redstone upgrade following the Ethereum Merge, validators have received priority fees, paid by users to incentivize faster processing of their transactions. They have also implemented maximum extractable value (MEV) capture strategies to receive additional revenue. Smart node operators can participate in MEV Boost relays and may select pre-approved Rocket Pool whitelisted strategies that fit their situation (regulated, non-regulated, etc.).\n\n**Users**\n\nOn the demand side, users (i.e., stakers) may deposit as little as 0.01 ETH to the Rocket Pool Deposit Pool in return for rETH, the Rocket Pool LSD token. rETH represents a user's stake of ETH in the Rocket Pool Protocol, and rETH accrues staking rewards as Rocket Pool node operators generate those rewards. Once deposited into the Rocket Pool protocol, deposits accumulate in the deposit pool, and 16 ETH of deposited ETH are matched with a node operator\u2019s 16 ETH.\n\nWhile stETH rebases, its underlying balance increases as yield accrues to the ",
