CEO Jared Grey announced several new initiatives designed to diversify and expand the platform\u2019s offerings.\n\nKey products set for release include Wara, a Solana-based trading platform, and Susa, an on-chain order book perpetual decentralized exchange (DEX). In addition, SushiSwap will launch Kubo, a tool to create new markets using delta-neutral strategies, and Blade, a liquidity value routing (LVR) automated market maker (AMM) solution.\n\n**Wara: Expanding Beyond EVM with Solana Integration**\n\nSushiSwap\u2019s ambitious plans include Wara, a comprehensive trading platform built on Solana. By expanding beyond Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) networks, SushiSwap aims to tap into the growing Solana ecosystem.\n\nThe integration of Solana is part of a broader strategy by SushiSwap to franchise its brand and product stack into new ecosystems. By doing so, SushiSwap hopes to diversify its user base and create a more robust decentralized finance environment. Wara is expected to offer a seamless trading experience, leveraging Solana\u2019s high performance and scalability.\n\n**Susa: A New On-Chain Order Book Perpetual DEX**\n\nAnother product coming in 2025 is Susa, a new perpetual DEX with an on-chain order book. Built on the N1 network, known for its high performance, Susa aims to provide a more efficient and transparent way for users to trade perpetual contracts. This will be SushiSwap\u2019s answer to the growing demand for decentralized exchanges that support sophisticated trading strategies, including leveraged positions.\n\nBy integrating an on-chain order book, Susa hopes to provide a more transparent and user-friendly alternative to centralized exchanges.\n\n**Kubo and Blade: Enhancing Market Creation and Liquidity**\n\nSushiSwap is also introducing Kubo, a new tool to launch markets with delta-neutral strategies. Delta-neutral strategies are designed to minimize exposure to price volatility, making them attractive for market makers and liquidity providers. Kubo will enable SushiSwap to bootstrap new markets and expand its offerings beyond traditional asset trading.\n\nIn addition, Blade, a novel LVR AMM solution, is designed to eliminate miner extractable value (MEV) for blue-chip assets. MEV, the profit miners can extract from reordering transactions, has been a significant concern for many DeFi protocols. By removing MEV from blue-chip assets, SushiSwap aims to provide more secure and fair trading opportunities for its users.\n\n**SushiSwap Aggregator: Scaling Distribution and Accessibility**\n\nOne of the key features of SushiSwap\u2019s 2025 strategy is the launch of its aggregator, which is already in production. The aggregator aims to enhance distribution by integrating new partners and expanding the platform\u2019s reach.\n\nBy scaling distribution and enhancing accessibility, SushiSwap aims to offer a comprehensive solution for decentralized trading and asset management.\n\n### Source 2: SushiSwap Unveils Ambitious 2025 Product Launches, Expanding DeFi Ecosystem - https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/9c022293-75df-4d0d-8be5-0363669ac29f\n\nSushiSwap, a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, revealed a bold roadmap for 2025.
