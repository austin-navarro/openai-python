By preserving history, it prevents others from rewriting it.\"\n\n\"Arweave's technology is based on a novel proof-of-access consensus mechanism, which ensures that miners replicate and store data over time. This mechanism is combined with a sustainable endowment to ensure that data is stored permanently.\"\n\n**Use cases and applications:**\n\n\"Arweave enables the creation of permanent, decentralized web applications. Developers can build applications that store data permanently, without the need for centralized servers.\"\n\n**Unique selling points and limitations:**\n\n\"Arweave's permaweb allows for the creation of immutable and permanent web pages and applications, ensuring that content remains accessible indefinitely.\"\n\n### Source 2: Messari - https://messari.io/asset/arweave\n\n**Market positioning and adoption metrics:**\n\n\"Arweave is a decentralized storage network that seeks to offer a platform for the indefinite storage of data. The network uses a native cryptocurrency, AR, to incentivize miners to store the network's information permanently.\"\n\n\"Arweave's storage endowment ensures that data is stored with a one-time fee, providing a sustainable model for permanent data storage.\"\n\n**Recent developments or updates:**\n\n\"Arweave has seen increasing adoption, with various projects and platforms integrating its permanent storage solutions.\"\n\n### Source 3: CoinGecko - https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arweave\n\n**Market positioning and adoption metrics:**\n\n\"Arweave (AR) is a cryptocurrency that powers the Arweave network, a decentralized storage platform that aims to provide permanent and immutable data storage.\"\n\n**Unique selling points and limitations:**\n\n\"Arweave's unique selling point is its ability to offer permanent data storage with a one-time fee, differentiating it from other storage solutions that require ongoing payments.\"\n\n**Recent developments or updates:**\n\n\"Arweave's market capitalization and trading volume have been growing, indicating increasing interest and adoption in the cryptocurrency community.\" ",
