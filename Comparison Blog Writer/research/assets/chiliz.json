It is governed by a network of 11 validators, including notable entities such as Animoca Brands, OKX, Paris Saint Germain, and Exaion, a subsidiary of EDF. The chain is powered by the Chiliz ($CHZ) token, serving as the network and governance token within this expanding ecosystem.\n\nReferred to as \"The Sports Blockchain,\" Chiliz Chain aims to establish the world's largest decentralized Web3 ecosystem, delivering products and services that connect fans and brands. It is the foundation of the SportFi movement, facilitating the transition from Web2 to Web3 in the sports sector, akin to how GameFi and SocialFi operate in gaming and social media, respectively.\n\nThe chain has witnessed rapid growth, with major sports organizations and innovators deploying projects that fuel the SportFi movement. These include fantasy football games for professional sports federations and leagues, metaverse-based football games, social games enabling competitions during live sports events, interactive trading card games minted on-chain, and AI sports fitness platforms featuring challenges curated by Olympians.\n\nTo inspire the developer community, Chiliz has organized hackathons in football stadiums and formed new partnerships to accelerate the chain's growth in key markets. This adoption and innovation are driving prominent sports brands to implement their Web3 visions, many of whom are already partners through the Fan Token network.\n\nFan Tokens, official crypto assets for over 70 major sports teams worldwide, initiated the first wave of blockchain-powered fan engagement on Socios.com, a leading fan engagement app. These tokens are now entering a new phase, integrating with new decentralized applications (dApps) built on the chain and extending mainstream sports intellectual properties across Web3. This expansion signifies that teams will become increasingly connected to Web3, bringing their extensive fan bases into the ecosystem, aligning with the SportFi vision.\n\n### Source 2: Chiliz launches layer-1 blockchain to expand fan token ecosystem - https://cointelegraph.com/news/chiliz-launches-layer-1-blockchain-to-expand-fan-token-ecosystem\n\nFive years after its inception, fan token platform Chiliz has launched its own layer-1 Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain ecosystem to support its growth. The validation of the Chiliz 2.0 blockchain genesis block marks the ecosystem's shift from Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens to its own layer 1.\n\nThe new blockchain employs a system of 11 active validators with proof-of-stake authority consensus, offering faster block times, lower fees, and reduced energy usage. Chiliz Chain 2.0 is a hard fork of BNB Chain, making it EVM compatible and attractive to decentralized application developers.\n\nChiliz has made significant strides in the sports and entertainment sector through its fan token app, Socios. The platform collaborates with major football teams like Barcelona, PSG, Manchester City, Arsenal, and Juventus, enabling them to mint nonfungible tokens (NFTs), fan tokens, and Web3-ready tickets, as well as develop dApps and Web3-based experiences and products.\n\nIn November 2022, Socios CEO Alexandre Dreyfus discussed the upcoming launch of the Chiliz '2.0' Blockchain, highlighting that the existing Chiliz chain was deliberately kept private to protect intellectual property. At that time, it had over 1.7 million wallets involved in the issuance, minting, and trading of fan tokens.\n\nDreyfus emphasized the importance of Ethereum as the foundation of the current ecosystem, noting that both iterations of the Chiliz blockchain are forks of Ethereum. The launch of Chiliz 2.0 signifies the transition to a \"real open layer 1,\" with on-chain governance capable of whitelisting certain nodes and developers to issue assets, ensuring authenticity and preventing counterfeit NFTs or fan tokens.\n\nThe CEO highlighted that a patient approach, allowing brands and franchises to maintain control of their image and property rights, was crucial for the ecosystem's growth over the past five years. The launch of the Chiliz blockchain aims to return value to ecosystem participants, with sports brands becoming nodes, staking their CHZ tokens to earn rewards, and participating in the network's growth.\n\n### Source 3: Chiliz announces $50M incubator and accelerator program for early-stage blockchain projects - https://cointelegraph.com/news/chiliz-announces-50m-incubator-and-accelerator-program-for-early-stage-blockchain-projects\n\nChiliz, a global blockchain company for sports and entertainment, has launched its incubator and accelerator program, Chiliz Labs, with the support of Jump Crypto. The $50 million program aims to invest in early-stage blockchain projects that leverage the Chiliz blockchain for sports and entertainment and the Socios.com partner network.\n\nChiliz intends to build the largest community of fans, brands, and developers in the sports and entertainment industry to create a dedicated sports Web3 ecosystem. These projects will utilize the new Chiliz blockchain for sports and entertainment, which had its genesis block validated on February 8. The incubator and accelerator program promises to provide funding and strategic guidance to assist these projects in achieving their goals.\n\nChiliz has announced LiveLike and FanFest as the first companies to build on the new chain, with eight to ten more enterprise-level projects to follow. These projects will include NFT ticketing pilots, athlete-focused Fan Tokens, and Web3 infrastructure partners building for sports and entertainment. Jump Crypto's president, Kanav Kariya, praised Chiliz for addressing the challenge of scaling brands and maximizing fan engagement sustainably and affordably.\n\nChiliz CEO Alexandre Dreyfus highlighted the importance of Chiliz Labs in building an ecosystem of fan experiences and transactions, with Fan Tokens providing a \"digital key\" that can work across any product or experience built on its infrastructure. Chiliz is the creator of Fan Tokens and the Socios.com fan engagement and rewards app, with more than 170 partners and over 1.8 million wallets.\n\nAs blockchain technology continues to revolutionize industries worldwide, it finds interesting use cases in sports with the emergence of Web3 platforms, offering new ways to engage fans and ",
