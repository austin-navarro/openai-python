As an open-source project, it falls into the category of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) products, leveraging smart contracts to facilitate trades without a centralized exchange. The protocol enables automated transactions between cryptocurrency tokens on the Ethereum blockchain through smart contracts. As of 2024, Uniswap is estimated to be the second-largest decentralized exchange and the seventh-largest cryptocurrency exchange overall by daily trading volume.\n\nUniswap Labs, founded in 2018 by Hayden Adams, is the software company behind Uniswap. In 2022, Uniswap Labs raised $165 million, following an announcement in 2021 that it was seeking to raise between $100 and $200 million, collaborating with Polychain. Uniswap offers products such as a self-custodial mobile wallet, a Trading API for professional users, and a web interface. These tools provide access to liquidity across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Optimism. The company has also partnered with traditional finance platforms like Fireblocks to integrate DeFi features into traditional financial systems, expanding its reach to institutional clients.\n\n### Source 2: V4 Architecture Overview | Uniswap - https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v4/concepts/v4-architecture-overview\n\nIn Uniswap V3, each pool had its own contract instance, making initializing pools and performing swaps in multiple pools costly. In V4, all pools are maintained within a single contract, providing substantial gas savings. Early calculations indicate that V4 will reduce the gas cost of creating pools by 99%. Hooks offer unlimited choices, and the single contract design facilitates seamless navigation through these options.\n\nThis Singleton design is enhanced by a new \"flash accounting\" method. Instead of moving assets in and out of pools after each swap in V3, this method only moves the net balances, resulting in a more efficient system and additional gas savings in Uniswap V4.\n\nDue to the efficiency of the Singleton contract and flash accounting, there is no need to limit fee tiers. Pool creators can select fee structures to be most competitive or adjust them with a dynamic fee hook. V4 also reintroduces support for native ETH, contributing to further gas savings.\n\n### Source 3: Uniswap v4 Explained: What\u2019s New in the Next Evolution of DeFi - https://coinomist.com/education/uniswap-v4-explained-whats-new/\n\nUniswap v4, announced in June 2023 and officially launched in February 2025, represents a significant evolution of decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This upgrade aims to reduce transaction fees, streamline liquidity management, and equip developers with advanced tools for building custom DeFi applications.\n\nKey innovations in Uniswap v4 include:\n\n- **Hooks**: These are external smart contracts that can be linked to a liquidity pool at various stages of its lifecycle\u2014before or after pool creation, liquidity provision, swaps, or liquidity withdrawals. This system introduces features such as automated limit orders, dynamic fee adjustments, DeFi protocol integrations, and MEV protection.\n\n- **Singleton Contract**: All liquidity pools are managed by a single smart contract\u2014PoolManager.sol. This design reduces pool creation costs, enhances the efficiency of multi-pool swaps, and simplifies upgrades and scalability.\n\n- **Flash Accounting**: A new settlement system designed to lower gas fees by eliminating unnecessary token movements within the protocol. Instead of multiple intermediate transactions, all balance changes are tracked within the contract first, and the actual token transfer happens only at the final settlement.\n\n- **Dynamic Fees**: A system that automatically adjusts fees based on market conditions, increasing them during high volatility to compensate liquidity providers and lowering them in stable periods to attract more traders.\n\n- **New ERC-6909 Standard for Liquidity Management**: This standard replaces ERC-721, making liquidity provisioning cheaper, more flexible, and easier to manage. It allows for lower costs for adding and removing liquidity, flexible asset management, and easier implementation of algorithmic strategies.\n\nThese enhancements position Uniswap v4 as a more efficient, customizable, and user-friendly platform for both traders and liquidity providers.
