One of the most notable changes was the transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism. This transition, known as \u201cThe Merge,\u201d has several implications:\n\n- **Energy Efficiency**: PoS consumes significantly less energy compared to PoW, making Ethereum a more eco-friendly option.\n- **Security**: PoS offers enhanced security features, reducing the risk of attacks.\n- **Scalability**: With full sharding implementation planned for 2023, Ethereum\u2019s transaction speed could potentially reach 100,000 transactions per second.\n\nThese technical aspects make Ethereum not just a cryptocurrency but a robust platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts.\n\n### Source 2: \"Ethereum\" - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum\n\nEthereum allows anyone to deploy decentralized applications onto it, with which users can interact. Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications provide financial instruments that do not directly rely on financial intermediaries like brokerages, exchanges, or banks. This facilitates borrowing against cryptocurrency holdings or lending them out for interest. Ethereum also allows users to create and exchange non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are tokens that can be tied to unique digital assets, such as images. Additionally, many other cryptocurrencies utilize the ERC-20 token standard on top of the Ethereum blockchain and have utilized the platform for initial coin offerings.\n\nOn 15 September 2022, Ethereum transitioned its consensus mechanism from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in an update known as \"The Merge\", which cut the blockchain's energy usage by 99%.\n\nOn March 13, 2024, \"Dencun\" or also \"Deneb-Cancun\" set of upgrade went live. These included EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding) which introduced \"blobs\" that could be used for general-purpose data-availability. Because \"Blob\" data is only stored temporarily, it is much cheaper than using normal call data for storage. This allows for L2 networks to greatly reduce the cost of posting compressed transaction data to L1.\n\nAccording to Ethereum.org, Prague-Electra (\"Pectra\") is expected to be launched in mid-2025. It brings various updates, including EIP-7251, which increases the staking amount per validator from exactly 32 ETH to anywhere between 32 ETH to 2048 ETH, and EIP-7702, which allows for the EOA addresses to use functionality from a smart contract.\n\n### Source 3: \"Ethereum Architecture Explained: A Deep Dive\" - https://toxigon.com/ethereum-architecture-explained\n\nEthereum's architecture can be broken down into several layers, each with its own set of components:\n\n1. **The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network**: At the bottom layer, we have the P2P network. This is where all the nodes (computers) in the Ethereum network communicate with each other. Each node runs the Ethereum software and maintains a copy of the blockchain. Nodes can be full nodes, which store the entire blockchain, or light nodes, which only store parts of it.\n\n2. **The Consensus Layer**: This is where the network agrees on the state of the blockchain. Until recently, Ethereum used a consensus mechanism called Proof of Work (PoW). However, Ethereum has transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS) with the launch of Ethereum 2.0. In PoS, validators stake their Ether (ETH) to validate transactions and secure the network. It's more energy-efficient and scalable than PoW.\n\n3. **The Data Layer**: The data layer is where all the information is stored. This includes the blockchain itself, which is a growing list of records (blocks) that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a list of transactions, and once a block is added to the chain, it can't be altered.\n\n4. **The Execution Layer**: The execution layer is where smart contracts are executed. This is done by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which is a Turing-complete virtual machine. The EVM allows developers to write smart contracts in languages like Solidity, which are then compiled into bytecode and executed on the EVM.\n\n5. **The Application Layer**: This is where all the decentralized applications (dApps) live. Developers can build anything from decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to games to social networks.\n\nEthereum 2.0, also known as Serenity, is a major upgrade to the Ethereum network. It aims to address some of the scalability and sustainability issues of the current network. The transition to PoS is a big part of this, but there's more to it.\n\n**Sharding**: One of the key features of Ethereum 2.0 is sharding. Sharding is a way of splitting the blockchain into smaller pieces, or shards, which can process transactions in parallel. This increases the throughput of the network and makes it more scalable.\n\n**The Beacon Chain**: The Beacon Chain is a new blockchain that runs alongside the main Ethereum blockchain. It's responsible for managing the PoS consensus mechanism and coordinating the shards.\n\nLayer 2 solutions are a way of scaling Ethereum without changing the underlying blockchain. They work by processing transactions off-chain, reducing the load on the main network. This can significantly reduce gas fees and increase throughput.\n\nThere are several types of layer 2 solutions, including:\n\n- **State Channels**: These allow users to conduct multiple off-chain transactions, with only the final state settled on the blockchain.\n- **Sidechains**: These are separate blockchains that run alongside the main Ethereum blockchain. They have their own consensus mechanisms and can process transactions independently.\n- **Rollups**: These bundle multiple off-chain transactions into a single on-chain transaction. There are two types of rollups: Optimistic Rollups and Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK-Rollups).\n\nLayer 2 solutions are a big deal for Ethereum. They allow for much higher throughput and lower fees, making Ethereum more practical for everyday use. ",
