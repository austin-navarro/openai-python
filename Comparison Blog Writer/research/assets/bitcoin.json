A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.\"\n\n\"We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.\"\n\n\"The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.\"\n\n\"The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes.\"\n\n\"The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.\"\n\n\"As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.\"\n\n\"The network itself requires minimal structure.\"\n\n\"Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.\"\n\n### Source 2: \"Bitcoin: A New Asset Class\" - https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/articles/bitcoin-a-new-asset-class\n\n\"Bitcoin is a decentralized digital asset that operates on a peer-to-peer network, allowing users to transact directly without intermediaries.\"\n\n\"It is often referred to as 'digital gold' due to its limited supply and store of value properties.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin's market capitalization has grown significantly since its inception, reaching over $1 trillion at its peak.\"\n\n\"Institutional adoption has increased, with companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin's use cases include remittances, as it allows for cross-border transactions without the need for traditional financial institutions.\"\n\n\"It also serves as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation in certain economies.\"\n\n\"However, Bitcoin faces limitations such as scalability issues, with the network capable of processing only about 7 transactions per second.\"\n\n\"Recent developments include the implementation of the Lightning Network, a second-layer solution aimed at improving transaction speed and scalability.\"\n\n### Source 3: \"Bitcoin: Technical Background and Data Analysis\" - https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs181/projects/2010-11/Bitcoin/technical.html\n\n\"Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.\"\n\n\"The blockchain is maintained by a network of nodes that follow a set of consensus rules to validate and propagate transactions.\"\n\n\"Each block in the blockchain contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus mechanism requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems to add new blocks to the blockchain.\"\n\n\"This process ensures the security and integrity of the network but also results in high energy consumption.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin's pseudonymous nature allows for privacy in transactions, but all transaction data is publicly accessible on the blockchain.\"\n\n\"The fixed supply of 21 million bitcoins introduces scarcity, which can influence its value over time.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin's decentralized nature makes it resistant to censorship and control by any single entity.\"\n\n\"However, this decentralization also means that there is no central authority to address issues such as fraud or disputes.\" ",
