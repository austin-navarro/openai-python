Like Raydium\u2019s legacy standard AMM pools, CPMM pools offer uniform liquidity distribution and asset pricing from zero to infinity.\n\n**Market Positioning and Adoption Metrics**\n\nRaydium\u2019s share of global DEX volume increased more than 130% QoQ to over 10%. Only Aerodrome on Base had a larger increase in volume share among the top six DEXs (global) in the third quarter. Additionally, Raydium flipped Orca to become the third-largest DEX by volume share in Q3, trailing only PancakeSwap and Uniswap.\n\n**Use Cases and Applications**\n\nIn September, Raydium launched Burn and Earn, which allows any liquidity provider to permanently lock the NFT representing the underlying position while all trading fees earned by the position remain claimable. In doing so, Burn and Earn enables project teams and token creators to increase community trust regarding liquidity provision while still allowing for the claiming of fees.\n\n**Recent Developments or Updates**\n\nOn Oct. 2, 2024, Raydium announced the launch of Teleport, a new feature enabling token transfers from EVM networks to Solana. Teleport integrates Circle\u2019s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) for the stablecoin USDC via CCTP\u2019s native mint and burn mechanism, as well Wormhole Connect, a React widget for cross-chain asset transfer via Wormhole.\n\n### Source 2: Raydium Outperforms Uniswap to become No.1 DEX - https://www.the-blockchain.com/2024/12/11/raydium-outperforms-uniswap-to-become-no-1-dex/\n\n**Market Positioning and Adoption Metrics**\n\nRaydium, a Solana-based DEX, has continued to cement its position as the leading decentralized exchange by trading volume. The exchange outperformed Uniswap and recorded the highest trading volume for two consecutive months, making it the number one DEX.\n\nA report by Messari, a provider of crypto market intelligence products, shows that Raydium traded thirty percent more in November than Uniswap. This translates to about $30 billion more in activity. The trend featured for the first time in October, where Raydium slightly trumped Uniswap by a 30% difference.\n\n**Use Cases and Applications**\n\nThe increased trading volumes in Raydium have been boosted significantly by memecoins. According to Messari, these digital assets comprised 65% of the exchange\u2019s monthly volume in November.\n\nAdopting applications like Pump.fun has made Solana a hub for memecoins. Pump.fun allows users to create new memecoins and offer them for active trading. These coins are later traded on the Raydium exchange, raising the DEX trading volume. Pump.fun contributed to $100M in fee revenues in November, indicating an upward trajectory of Raydium.\n\n**Unique Selling Points and Limitations**\n\nThe success of Raydium can also be attributed to Solana\u2019s technical strengths. Decentralized finance (DeFi) enthusiasts are attracted to the blockchain\u2019s high throughput and low transaction fees. This has helped push Solana\u2019s total value locked (TVL) to around 5x its value in 2024.\n\nDespite being outcompeted by Ethereum, which has over $70 billion of total value locked, Solana makes transactions faster and cheaper. Raydium has benefited from these advantages in attracting users looking for optimized trading solutions within the ecosystem.\n\n### Source 3: Raydium Surpasses Uniswap in Monthly DEX Volumes - https://messari.io/report/raydium-surpasses-uniswap-in-monthly-dex-volumes\n\n**Technical Aspects and Features**\n\nIn March 2024, Raydium released its V3 user interface in beta. This interface introduced a new portfolio page for users to view and manage liquidity positions, a liquidity page that consolidates all Raydium liquidity pools in one place, support for exact swap amounts, and charts for all tradable token pairs. In May 2024, Raydium V3 fully launched alongside revamped constant product market maker (CPMM) pools that support the Token-2022 token program and include a built-in price oracle. Like Raydium\u2019s legacy standard AMM pools, CPMM pools offer uniform liquidity distribution and asset pricing from zero to infinity.\n\n**Market Positioning and Adoption Metrics**\n\nOctober was Raydium\u2019s first month as the number one DEX by volume across all chains, marking a significant milestone in the evolving landscape of decentralized finance. This change reflects both the relative strength of Raydium to other DEXs on Solana and Solana\u2019s increasing share of global DEX volume (49% in November 2024). In November 2024, Raydium consistently captured over 60% of daily DEX volume on Solana, and Solana had a nearly 50% share of monthly DEX volume across all chains, 175% more than Ethereum\u2019s roughly 18% share.\n\n**Use Cases and Applications**\n\nPerhaps the most significant recent driver of Raydium's volume has been the surge in memecoin trading. Following the U.S. presidential election on November 5, 2024, Raydium averaged almost $2 billion in mem ",
