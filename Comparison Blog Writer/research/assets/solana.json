None of the major blockchains come close to achieving this property. Achieving this is Solana\u2019s north star.\n\nProof of Work systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum support about 10 transactions per second (TPS). Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance-based (PBFT) Proof of Stake (PoS) systems like Tendermint support about 1,000 TPS with 100\u2013200 nodes. Solana, a PBFT-like PoS blockchain, supports upwards of 50,000 TPS with over 200 nodes on current testnet iterations, making it the most performant blockchain and the world\u2019s first web-scale decentralized network.\n\nSince its inception, the Solana team\u2014comprised of pioneering technologists from Qualcomm, Intel, Netscape, and Google\u2014has focused on building the tech required for Solana to function with these groundbreaking performance standards.\n\nIn order to create a decentralized, permissionless network that matches the performance of a single node, the Solana team developed 8 key technologies:\n\n- Proof of History (POH) \u2014 a clock before consensus;\n- Tower BFT\u2014 a PoH-optimized version of PBFT;\n- Turbine \u2014 a block propagation protocol;\n- Gulf Stream \u2014 Mempool-less transaction forwarding protocol;\n- Sealevel\u2014 Parallel smart contracts run-time;\n- Pipelining \u2014 a Transaction Processing Unit for validation optimization;\n- Cloudbreak \u2014 Horizontally-Scaled Accounts Database; and\n- Archivers \u2014 Distributed ledger storage.\n\nAs a result of these 8 major innovations, the Solana network is a lightning fast distributed ledger technology that will always keep going. It is not slowed down by consensus. Moreover, the system optimizes data propagation, leverages parallel GPUs massively for transaction processing, and does not weigh down validators with massive stored chain history.\n\nSolana\u2019s software is designed to get out of the way and let the hardware operate at capacity. As such, Solana scales naturally with bandwidth, SSDs, and GPU cores. It is the only blockchain that does, and is how Solana achieves 50,000 TPS on a network of 200 physically distinct nodes around the world.\n\n### Source 2: Solana (blockchain platform) - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solana_%28blockchain_platform%29\n\nSolana is a blockchain platform which uses a proof-of-stake mechanism to provide smart contract functionality. Its native cryptocurrency is SOL.\n\nSolana was launched in 2020 by Solana Labs, which was founded by Anatoly Yakovenko and Raj Gokal in 2018. The blockchain has experienced several major outages, was subjected to a hack, and a class action lawsuit was filed alleging that Solana sells unregistered securities, and misled investors about the number of tokens.\n\nSolana's total current trading value was in January 2022. However, by the end of 2022, this had fallen to around $3 billion following the bankruptcy of FTX. Following the general rise of the cryptocurrency market in 2023, its current trading value rose to $7 billion.\n\n### Source 3: 8 Innovations That Make Solana The First Web-Scale Blockchain - https://chaintechsource.com/blog/8-innovations-that-make-solana-the-first-web-scale-blockchain/\n\nSolana is a web-scale blockchain that enables decentralized apps and markets to run quickly and securely. The Solana-based blockchain supports up to 50,000 TPS (Transactions Per Second) and 400ms Block Times. The Solana software\u2019s ultimate goal is to demonstrate that there is a viable set of algorithms that can be combined to form a blockchain.\n\nAs a result, transaction throughput would increase according to network capacity, achieving all of the properties of a blockchain, including scalability, security, and decentralization. More evidently, the system will be able to support an upper band of 710,000 TPS on a standard gigabit network and 28.4 million TPS on a 40-gigabit network.\n\nFor developing a decentralized and permissionless network that aligns with the performance of a single node, Solana developed 8 key technologies:\n\n- Proof of History (POH) \u2013 a clock before consensus\n- Tower BFT \u2013 a PoH optimized version of PBFT\n- Turbine \u2013 a block propagation protocol\n- Gulf Stream \u2013 Memepool-less transaction forwarding protocol\n- Sealevel \u2013 Parallel smart contracts run time\n- Pipelining \u2013 a Transaction processing unit for validation optimization\n- Cloudbreak \u2013 Horizontally-scaled accounts database and\n- Archivers \u2013 Distributed ledger storage\n\nProof of History (POH), a globally available, permissionless source of time on the network that works before consensus, is the key Solana innovation. POH is not an anti-Sybil mechanism or a consensus procedure. POH, on the other hand, is a solution to the clock problem.\n\nUnlike other blockchains, which require validators to communicate with one another in order to agree that time has passed, each Solana validator keeps track of time by encoding it in a simple SHA-256, sequential hashing verifiable delay function (VDF). For unpredictability, Solana does not employ a VDF. Instead, each validator keeps its own clock using the VDF. Leader selection is planned ahead of time for an entire era because each validator has its own clock.\n\nSolana runs Tower Consensus on top of Proof of History, a PBFT-like consensus algorithm that takes advantage of the synchronized clock. Tower Consensus, unlike TBFT, values liveliness over uniformity. Nodes, like PBFT, increase the timeouts of all other validators in the network exponentially.\n\nSolana can optimize how blocks are transported through the network ",
