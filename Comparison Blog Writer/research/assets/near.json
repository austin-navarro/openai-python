This reduces resource requirements and operational costs, and eliminates the need to maintain local shard states.\n\n- As of Q3 2024, NEAR operates on six shards and aims to scale to ten shards by the end of the year.\n\n**Market Positioning and Adoption Metrics:**\n\n- NEAR's stablecoin market cap ended Q3 2024 at approximately $633.50 million, up ~21.12% quarter-over-quarter, driven by a renewed focus on DeFi.\n\n- The average daily active returning addresses increased ~7.27% quarter-over-quarter; the average daily new addresses increased ~11.06% quarter-over-quarter; while the average daily transactions saw a decline of ~10.48% quarter-over-quarter.\n\n- NEAR's DeFi Total Value Locked (TVL) ended Q3 2024 at approximately $251.44 million, reflecting a ~7.63% increase from the previous quarter.\n\n**Use Cases and Applications:**\n\n- NEAR is focusing on enabling the network to become the home for User-Owned AI, investing in core AI infrastructure through the NEAR Horizon AI Incubator, the NEAR Foundation x Delphi Labs AI Accelerator, and additional R&D efforts through NEAR.AI.\n\n- The NEAR AI ecosystem includes over 50 teams building at every layer of the User-Owned AI stack.\n\n**Unique Selling Points and Limitations:**\n\n- Nightshade 2.0 bolsters NEAR\u2019s capacity to handle a growing number of users and transactions by an estimated 400% increase in transaction execution speed.\n\n- The reduced operational costs lower barriers to entry for validators, while enhancing decentralization and security.\n\n**Recent Developments or Updates:**\n\n- The first bridge, TokenBridge, connecting NEAR and Solana, was launched on July 25, 2024, built by Crowny and powered by Wormhole technology.\n\n- Stateless Validation, also known as Nightshade 2.0, launched on mainnet on August 22, 2024, improving throughput for each shard by 5x and increasing the total number of shards available for the network.\n\n### Source 2: NEAR Protocol: An Emerging Force in the Crypto Space - https://www.iconomi.com/blog/near-protocol-an-emerging-force\n\n**Technical Aspects, Features, and Architecture:**\n\n- NEAR Protocol focuses on scalability, interoperability, and user-friendly blockchain technology, aiming to make blockchain accessible to a broader audience.\n\n- The Nightshade 2.0 upgrade introduces \"stateless validation,\" allowing validators to retrieve all necessary information directly from the blockchain, reducing the need for local state maintenance.\n\n**Market Positioning and Adoption Metrics:**\n\n- NEAR's market capitalization has surpassed $4 billion, demonstrating strong growth and stability, positioning it as a compelling investment option during periods of high market volatility.\n\n**Recent Developments or Updates:**\n\n- The Nightshade 2.0 upgrade, which went live on the mainnet on August 22, 2024, is designed to enhance the network\u2019s scalability and efficiency, further solidifying NEAR\u2019s reputation as a leading Layer 1 blockchain platform.\n\n### Source 3: The NEAR Protocol Ecosystem: Comprehensive Analysis and Updates, Future Outlook 2025 - https://www.thecryptomarketcap.com/posts/the-near-protocol-ecosystem-comprehensive-analysis-and-updates-2025\n\n**Technical Aspects, Features, and Architecture:**\n\n- NEAR Protocol implements sharding, a technique that partitions the network into smaller groups of nodes, allowing for parallel processing of transactions. This design significantly enhances throughput and reduces latency, enabling NEAR Protocol to scale effectively as demand increases.\n\n- NEAR utilizes a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, considered more energy-efficient and potentially more secure than Proof-of-Work (PoW) used by Bitcoin.\n\n**Market Positioning and Adoption Metrics:**\n\n- NEAR has attracted significant investment and is gaining traction within the blockchain industry.\n\n**Use Cases and Applications:**\n\n- NEAR has a thriving NFT ecosystem and is making strides in blockchain-based gaming.\n\n- Paras and Mintbase are leading platforms for NFT creation and trading, with a focus on digital art and collectibles.\n\n- Human Guild supports gaming projects on NEAR, offering grants and developer assistance.\n\n**Unique Selling Points and Limitations:**\n\n- NEAR offers a compelling combination of scalability, speed, affordability, user-friendliness, security, and a growing ecosystem, making it a strong contender in the blockchain space.\n\n- NEAR is a relatively young protocol compared to some established players. While it shows promise, its long-term success will depend on continued development and adoption.\n\n**Recent Developments or Updates:**\n\n- In 2023, NEAR launched the Blockchain Operating System (BOS) and NEAR Horizon for project support.
