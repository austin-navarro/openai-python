Synths track the price of external assets through oracles like Chainlink, Pyth, and Uniswap V3 TWAP. Users can trade in both spot and perpetual futures (perps) markets for synthetic assets. SNX is the native protocol token, used for governance and as collateral backing for the protocol's liquidity.\n\n- With the launch of Synthetix V3 on Base in Q2 2024, the protocol transitioned to a new architecture that supports multiple collateral types for minting the Synthetix stablecoin, sUSD. These collateral types now include SNX, ETH, USDC, and yield-generating assets like stataUSDC.\n\n**Market Positioning and Adoption Metrics:**\n\n- The adoption of Synthetix V3 perps has increased QoQ since launching in Q2. V3 now represents 30% of all perps trading volume as opposed to 27% in Q2. Trading volume for perps dipped QoQ for both V2 and V3, decreasing by 24% and 13%, respectively. Overall, perps volume fell for the third straight quarter to $5.1 billion, down 21% QoQ.\n\n- Synthetix had 57 new perp markets come online, up 90% QoQ from Q2\u2019s 30 new perp markets.\n\n**Use Cases and Applications:**\n\n- Synthetix Perps is the protocol\u2019s leading product, allowing users to trade in both spot and perpetual futures markets for synthetic assets.\n\n**Unique Selling Points and Limitations:**\n\n- Synthetix V3 on Base takes 40% of fees generated from perp trading and allocates them to buying back and burning bridged SNX.\n\n- SNX\u2019s supply is now deflationary after the protocol stopped inflation in Q4 2023.\n\n**Recent Developments or Updates:**\n\n- In Q3, the Synthetix DAO approved a governance redesign and overhaul aimed at reducing inefficiencies and increasing governance effectiveness.\n\n- Synthetix V3\u2019s TVL increased by 117%, mainly due to Ethereum LPs migrating from V2 to V3.\n\n### Source 2: Synthetix Q2 2024 Brief \u2013 Digital Currency Research - https://digitalcurrencyresearch.io/2024/09/26/synthetix-q2-2024-brief/\n\n**Technical Aspects, Features, and Architecture:**\n\n- Synthetix (SNX) is a decentralized synthetic asset issuance and liquidity protocol that allows users to trade synthetic assets (Synths).

Synthetic assets track the price of external assets through oracles like Chainlink, Pyth, and Uniswap V3 TWAP. Users can trade in both spot and perpetual futures (perps) markets for synthetic assets. SNX is the native protocol token, used for governance and as collateral backing for the protocol's liquidity.\n\n- Synthetix has two prominent versions being used today, V2 and V3. Synthetix V2 primarily uses SNX as collateral for staking and issuing synthetic assets, whereas V3 introduces a more modular system that supports multiple collateral types. V3 was initially deployed to Base in Q2\u201924 and subsequently deployed to Arbitrum in Q3\u201924.\n\n**Market Positioning and Adoption Metrics:**\n\n- Open interest hit a yearly high on November 21 of $367.1 million. Daily average OI was $195.4 million, up 45% QoQ from $134.8 million.\n\n- Daily average perp volumes increased 29% QoQ, culminating in an average daily perps volume of ",
