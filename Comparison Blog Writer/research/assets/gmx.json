With GMX powered by dappOS V2, users can trade and buy GLP/GM (GMX's LP tokens) with enhanced features and intent-centric UX. The simplified workflow optimizes the execution time by 90% and reduces execution fees by up to 20%. Users can deploy the total balance of their assets regardless of the distribution, confirm complicated, interdependent transactions across different chains with a single signature and pay fees in any tokens. dappOS received a GMX grant and both projects plan to jointly launch incentive programs soon.\n\nAbout dappOS\n\ndappOS V2 is providing CeFi - like user experience and a complete decentralization at the same time with new features of unified account, support for task dependency, and a new bidding system. dappOS reward system also provides long-term incentives for users.\n\nAbout GMX\n\nGMX is a decentralized derivatives exchange that allows users to trade perpetual contracts. These contracts enable traders to speculate on the future price movements of cryptocurrencies without actually holding the underlying asset. With a unique approach to liquidity and trading combined with the benefits of a decentralized architecture, GMX is a leader in the rapidly innovating DeFi derivatives space.\n\n### Source 2: A Guide to GMX: Decentralized Perpetual Exchange and Crypto - https://beincrypto.com/learn/gmx-crypto/\n\nGMX is a decentralized exchange (DEX) focused on spot and perpetual trading. It launched on Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer-2 network, in September 2021. Before migrating to Arbitrum, GMX went by the name Gambit Financial.\n\nGambit was a DEX on the BNB Smart Chain, previously Binance Smart Chain. The project merged the four tokens it had at the time into GMX to minimize complexity and then went on to launch on Arbitrum. These four tokens were XVIX, GMT, XLGE, and xGMT. The project made it possible to swap these assets at a rate of 2 USD for 1 GMX. The GMX crypto is now the exchange\u2019s utility and governance token.\n\nIn January 2022, GMX expanded its supporting underlying blockchains to include Avalanche, an EVM-compatible smart contract chain for decentralized applications (DApps). According to data on DefiLlama at the time of writing, the total value locked (TVL) on GMX, inclusive of staked assets, is $1.16 billion. Arbitrum contributes $1.03 billion to this TVL, while Avalanche\u2019s contributes only $125.99 million.\n\nGMX hasn\u2019t offered clear information as to who its founders are. However, two of the people that can sign a multisig wallet connected to GMX are Krunal Amin, the founder of UniDex, and Benjamin Simon, the co-founder of Stealth Crypto. Also, one of the project\u2019s developers is someone using the pseudonym X on Twitter.\n\nGMX has a governing community of 63,000 members as of this writing. People that hold the GMX token can vote for or against project proposals.\n\nGMX hasn\u2019t revealed much information on its funding rounds either. Nonetheless, an article on its Medium page indicates that the development treasury has about 1.8 million held in USDC to sustain the team until March 2024. Furthermore, Gambit raised funds through a token sale. These funds may have been migrated to GMX when the project was rebranded.\n\nSome companies have invested in the protocol by holding significant positions in GMX crypto. For instance, Blocktower has purchased GMX worth more than 2,400 ETH and has staked 336,478 GMX. Flood Capital is also a top holder of GMX, although the exact holdings aren\u2019t publicly known. GMX\u2019s most prominent individual holder is Arthur Hayes, founder and former CEO of BitMEX. He is said to own over 200,000 GMX.\n\nAccording to the last roadmap update published in May 2022, GMX\u2019s to-do list consisted of increasing platform security and monitoring and introducing support for synthetic markets to improve user experience. Moreover, the exchange is considering deploying on new chains such as Coinbase\u2019s Base, an Ethereum layer-2 network.\n\nAnother plan on GMX\u2019s roadmap is creating a new automated market maker that gives projects and pool creators full control over a pool\u2019s functions. This improvement will allow creators to customize functions like adding and removing liquidity and setting flexible fees.\n\nGMX is a decentralized exchange where people can trade assets on-chain by simply connecting their wallets. Users can also earn rewards by providing liquidity to the exchange or by staking the GMX crypto.\n\nA multi-asset pool facilitates trading on the GMX exchange. It comprises an index of assets that traders use to swap and trade perpetual contracts using leverage. A perpetual contract is a type of financial derivative that is an agreement without expiry dates that expose traders to the underlying asset without owning it. At the time of writing, index assets included USDC, BTC, ETH, LINK, FRAX, DAI, and USDT. This multi-asset pool, also referred to as the GLP pool, is community-owned.\n\n ",
