As part of this shift, Chainlink is playing a significant role in enabling three landmark capital markets solutions under the Monetary Authority of Singapore\u2019s (MAS) Project Guardian, an industry initiative led by what is considered to be one of the most progressive regulatory bodies globally when it comes to integrating blockchain technology within financial markets.\n\nThe following industry participants collaborated:\n\n- Swift\u2014Global member-owned cooperative and the world\u2019s leading provider of secure financial messaging services to more than 11,500 banks.\n- UBS Asset Management\u2014Large-scale investment manager with over $1.6T assets under management (AUM).\n- ANZ Bank\u2014Australian institutional bank with $1T+ AUM.\n- SBI Digital Markets\u2014Singapore-based subsidiary of the digital asset arm of Japan\u2019s leading conglomerate SBI Group providing digital asset solutions.\n- ADDX\u2014Singapore-based fully regulated digital securities exchange.\n\nMAS\u2019s Project Guardian is a collaborative initiative involving policymakers and the world\u2019s largest financial institutions and market infrastructures. Project Guardian\u2019s goal is to use blockchain infrastructure to tangibly demonstrate how tokenization and smart contracts are transforming the financial markets through asset tokenization.\n\nThe first two Project Guardian solutions Chainlink is powering focus on streamlining traditional fund operations end-to-end. Traditional fund operations often face inefficiencies in subscription and redemption processes, including manual interventions, delayed settlements, and a lack of real-time transparency. These inefficiencies lead to increased operational costs, reduced liquidity, and missed investment opportunities across the $63 trillion global mutual fund market. The third Project Guardian solution addresses regulatory requirements for keeping tokenized asset transaction details confidential, even when they use the public Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) network to settle across different private and public blockchains.\n\n**Swift, UBS Asset Management, and Chainlink Bridge Tokenized Assets With Existing Payment Systems**\n\nSwift, UBS Asset Management, and Chainlink successfully settled tokenized fund subscriptions and redemptions using the Swift network. This initiative enables digital asset transactions to settle offchain in fiat using an established payment system that\u2019s already widely adopted by more than 11,500 financial institutions, across over 200 countries and territories.\n\nSwift, UBS, and Chainlink\u2019s work proves how financial institutions can leverage blockchain technology, the Chainlink Platform, and the Swift network to settle subscriptions and redemptions for tokenized investment fund vehicles, thereby allowing the straight-through-processing of the payment leg without the need for global adoption of an onchain form of payment. This helps in the automation of the entire lifecycle of the fund redemption and subscription process.\n\nDiagram showing how Swift and Chainlink are enabling fiat payment rails to facilitate subscription and redemptions of tokenized funds. Swift and Chainlink are bringing existing payment systems to the digital assets economy.\n\nThe solution builds on the previous use case described above where UBS Asset Management and SBI Digital Markets created a digital subscription and redemption system for tokenized funds. The project used existing Swift payment rails, which enable end-to-end payment orchestration capabilities to settle fund subscriptions and redemptions. Swift previously demonstrated how its existing infrastructure can provide a secure, scalable way for financial institutions to connect to multiple types of blockchain, and the latest solution with Chainlink\u2019s platform orchestrated the necessary interactions between each of the respective actors to fulfill the pre-conditions for which a UBS tokenized investment fund will automatically mint or burn fund tokens for investors.\n\n> \u201cOur work with UBS Asset Management and Chainlink in MAS\u2019 Project Guardian leverages the global Swift network to bridge digital assets with established systems.\u201d\u2014Jonathan Ehrenfeld, Head of Strategy at Swift\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n- Leverages existing payment infrastructure\n- Enables broad market participation without requiring onchain cash\n- Combines benefits of tokenization with traditional settlement\n- Accelerates institutional adoption\n\nAt this year\u2019s Singapore FinTech Festival, industry leaders from Swift, UBS, and Chainlink dove into the details of their landmark solution and showed how institutions can leverage the Chainlink Platform to enable digital asset transactions to settle along existing payment rails. Watch the full session below:\n\n**SBI Digital Markets, UBS Asset Management, and Chainlink Unlock Automated Fund Administration and Transfer Agency**\n\nSBI Digital Markets, UBS Asset Management, and Chainlink successfully completed their implementation of a tokenized fund, showcasing how tokenization, smart contracts, and Chainlink infrastructure can automate the fund management process for traditional fund administrators and transfer agents. This unlocks a fundamental shift in how the industry\u2019s $132T global assets under management can begin to operate using blockchains.\n\nThe adoption of tokenized funds by the world\u2019s largest asset managers has created a need for the fund administration industry to evolve into an onchain format. The UBS, SBIDM, and Chainlink solution shows how existing fund administration processes can apply to tokenized funds across multiple chains. The key insight is that existing systems already widely in use for fund administration processes can become compatible with tokenized funds once they\u2019re made compatible with blockchains and smart contracts via Chainlink.\n\n**ADDX, ANZ, and Chainlink Introduce Privacy-Enabled Cross-Chain, Cross-Border Connectivity for Tokenized Commercial Paper**\n\nADDX, in collaboration with ANZ and Chainlink, presented a solution focused on the entire asset lifecycle of tokenized commercial paper for cross-border transactions. The solution leverages ADDX\u2019s investment platform, ANZ\u2019s Digital Asset Services, and Chainlink\u2019s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), including its recently announced Private Transactions capability.\n\nFor this solution, the participants have selected commercial paper as the candidate asset class. The short duration of the commercial paper makes it possible to showcase the entire asset lifecycle, from issuance and subscription to settlement and redemption. This transaction shows that regulated financial entities can securely tokenize and execute ",
