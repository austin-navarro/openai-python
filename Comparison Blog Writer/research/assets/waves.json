Waves (WAVES) aims to enable a collection of decentralized open-source technologies so that developers may create scalable, usable apps. With Waves, an extensive blockchain ecosystem will be developed that offers several capabilities required for corporate adoption.\n\nDecentralized apps (DApps) and smart contracts are two of the many use cases supported by Waves, a multipurpose blockchain platform. Following one of the first initial coin offers (ICO) in the crypto sector, Waves was introduced in June 2016 to enhance the first blockchain platforms by boosting speed, functionality, and usability. To improve upon its original concept, the platform has undergone numerous adjustments and included fresh spin-off features.\n\nThe native token of Waves is WAVES, a coin with an unlimited quantity that is used for customary payments like block rewards. It has its own on-chain governance, uses a modified proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol called Leased PoS, and has its own programming language called RIDE. \u201cWaves Enhancement Proposals\u201d are on-chain changes that WAVES holders can vote on (WEP). Any modifications to the protocol must receive the support of 80% of the participants.\n\nThe proof-of-stake algorithm/protocol used by Waves is called WavesNG. Emin G\u00fcn Sirer, a well-known proponent of Bitcoin and a Cornell University developer, created Bitcoin-NG, a scaling proposal, on which the technology is built. The protocol eliminates the likelihood of forks while greatly accelerating network throughput and reducing the time required to create a new block.\n\nIt emphasizes that its open-source code offers more maintenance simplicity and trust than closed-source business blockchain solutions. As an illustration, we have a leader block, three batches of blocks, and each batch has three blocks in it. A public key that identifies the elected leader is contained in leader blocks, which are generated via proof of stake but do not contain transactions (player).\n\nEach block has a header that includes, among other elements, a cryptographic hash of the predecessor header that serves as the block\u2019s unique reference (either a key block or a microblock). The cryptographic hash of a key block\u2019s header must be smaller than the goal value, just like in Bitcoin, for it to be considered genuine. A key block in Waves-NG holds a public key that will be applied to upcoming micro blocks.\n\nWAVES can be used to develop an extensive blockchain ecosystem that offers several capabilities required for corporate adoption. An entirely new world of NFTs, DAOs and other new business models is made possible by Waves. It offers incredibly quick service at incredibly low prices. It also aims to maximize blockchain technology while leaving a small carbon footprint. Waves provide easy interoperability by connecting to various ecosystems.\n\n- Fixed Fees: Other than network overload, all network fees are fixed. Protocol designing and its smart contract language allowed for the implementation of this capability. Similar to ordinary contracts in every way, smart contracts operate on blockchain as protocols as opposed to being written on paper.\n\n- Swift transactions: The protocol aims to support 1,000 transactions per second or more. This is crucial for DeFi apps with numerous users and frequently low-volume transactions.\n\n- Staking: With the Waves protocol, token owners of WAVES are able to earn a passive income by staking their tokens.\n\n- User-friendly: Waves ecosystem strives to offer a single point of entry.\n\n- Developer ecosystem \u2013 The Waves ecosystem aims to provide a range of products, tools, and elements to simplify the creation and administration of DApps.\n\nWith 100 million available tokens at launch in 2016, WAVES was a fixed-cap token for the Waves platform. 85% of the supply in its ICO, which collected 30,000 BTC, was distributed to sale participants, 9% to the developers, 4% to partners and supporters, and 1% to early backers and bounty programs that were held after the ICO. In June 2016, the token entered the market for roughly $1.\n\nOn August 2, 2016, the price of WAVES hit a record low of $0.1227, and on May 4, 2021, it reached a high of $41.33. With time, its usefulness grew, and in 2019, the supply cap was removed, with decision-making shifting to network users. Users must decide whether or not to reduce the block reward by 0.5 WAVES every 110,000 blocks in order to adjust the current block reward of 6 WAVES.\n\nWaves\u2019 current live price is USD 6.16, and its 24-hour trading volume is USD 297,262,499 as of today (11-08-2022). In the past 24 hours, Waves has increased 7.34%. With a live market cap of USD 671,790,086. There are 109,028,044 Waves coins in circulation. When token owners decided to convert WAVES from a fixed asset to an inflationary one in October 2019, resulting in the situation that the overall amount of tokens may rise over time.\n\nWaves set out to improve on the early blockchain platforms and goods as one of the first offers in its industry. Its first goal was to attract potential company customers who wanted to use blockchain to enhance workflows or develop new services. Waves assisted in the creation of smart contracts and DApps, guaranteeing that their speeds and usability outperformed those of the competitors at the time.\n\nSince then, further products have emerged, such as the cross-chain and oracle network Gravity and the platform Neutrino which focuses on decentralized finance (DeFi). A decentralized crypto exchange is called Waves DEX. By making the WAVES token ",
