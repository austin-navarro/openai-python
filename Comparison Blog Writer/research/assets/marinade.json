Native staking now comprises 31% of Marinade's TVL.\n\nProtected Staking Rewards (PSR) safeguarded staker yields, recovering 1,200 SOL in Q3. PSR requires validators to put up a SOL bond to be eligible for a stake in Marinade.\n\nmSOL deposits in DeFi fell 3% QoQ to 1.2 million. Kamino led TVL for the second quarter in a row with 357,900 mSOL.\n\nMarinade removed the 6% stake fee from its liquid staking product, meaning its remaining revenue was generated from unstaking and the Stake Auction Marketplace.\n\nTotal Staked SOL fell 4% QoQ to 7.9 million in Q3. Including native staking, Marinade holds a 33% market share against Solana liquid staking providers.\n\nMarinade (MNDE) is an automated staking protocol on Solana that provides liquid and native staking solutions. Marinade was founded during the March 2021 Solana x Serum Hackathon and launched on mainnet on August 2, 2021.\n\nmSOL APY increased by 5% QoQ to 7.6%. Concurrently, network activity on Solana increased across several metrics in Q3, including average daily fee payers, average transaction fees, and TVL.\n\nMarinade delegates SOL to 178 validators, a 41% QoQ decrease. The decrease in validators follows a recent upgrade to the delegation strategy that tied validator growth to Marinade\u2019s TVL strategy.\n\nProtected Staking Rewards (PSR) was launched in April 2024, with over 400 validators participating from the outset. PSR enforces an onchain service-level agreement protecting stakers from reduced rewards for validator performance issues or commission rugs.\n\nMarinade's Q3 2024 performance highlights its resilience and innovation. Total Value Locked (TVL) increased 9% QoQ to $849.3 million, while mSOL APY grew 5% to 7.6%.\n\n### Source 2: Understanding Marinade: A Comprehensive Overview - https://messari.io/report/understanding-marinade-a-comprehensive-overview\n\nMarinade Finance is an automated staking protocol on Solana that provides liquid and native staking solutions.\n\nMarinade has over $1.8 billion in TVL. At $1.2 billion, Marinade Liquid recently lost its place as Solana\u2019s top liquid staking protocol to Jito. However, Marinade Native quickly grew to $630 million TVL in 6 months.\n\nNotable upcoming upgrades include Protected Staking Rewards and a delegation strategy update. Together, they will allow Marinade to expand the number of validators it delegates to without sacrificing performance by covering staking reward losses.\n\nAn ongoing Marinade Earn campaign rewards Marinade stakers and delegation governors with Marinade\u2019s native token MNDE.\n\nMarinade delegates SOL to around 250 validators. Distribution figures of Marinade\u2019s delegated stake are the following:\n\n- 10 validators make up the top 33% of Marinade delegated stake.\n- 32 validators make up the top 50% of Marinade delegated stake.\n- 115 validators make up the top 90% of Marinade delegated stake.\n\nBefore the latest delegation strategy upgrade in March 2023, Marinade delegated to over 450 validators.\n\nMarinade was the first liquid staking solution on Solana. Since its August 2021 launch, it has amassed 6.7 million SOL ($1.2 billion as of March 15, 2024) in liquid staking TVL, but growth has stagnated since the end of 2021 due to the bear market and more competition.\n\nHowever, Marinade as a whole has continued to grow with the launch of Marinade Native, a native staking solution. Since its July 2023 launch, Marinade Native has gained 3.6 million SOL in TVL ($630 million as of March 15, 2024).\n\nThe continued rollout of Protected Staking Rewards and the upcoming delegation strategy upgrade will allow Marinade to expand the number of validators it delegates to without sacrificing performance.\n\n### Source 3: Marinade | Stake Automation Platform | Code Review - https://research.tokenmetrics.com/marinade-code-review/\n\nMarinade is a sophisticated stake automation platform tailored for Solana, allowing users to optimize their staking rewards through a blend of native and liquid staking options.\n\nWith a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $2 billion and an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of 8.38%, Marinade stands out as a prominent player in the Solana staking ecosystem.\n\nMarinade introduces innovative approaches to Solana staking, particularly with its liquid staking option. By tokenizing staked SOL into mSOL, users can utilize their stake in various decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, enhancing capital efficiency within the Solana ecosystem.\n\nMoreover, Marinade\u2019s governance token, MNDE, facilitates community involvement in protocol decisions, ensuring a decentralized and inclusive governance model.\n\nThe architecture of Marinade is robust, leveraging smart contracts for liquid staking while ensuring non-custodial ownership of assets.\n\nThe platform\u2019s integration with over 100 high-performing validators provides users a diverse and reliable network for staking operations.\n\nFurthermore, the absence of smart contract usage in native staking minimizes potential risks associated with smart contract vulnerabilities.
