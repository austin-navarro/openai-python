Its main contribution is a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism and a Secure Proof of Stake (SPoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, Elrond can process upwards of 15,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 6-second latency and negligible cost, attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy.\"\n\n**Market positioning and adoption metrics:**\n\n\"Elrond's mainnet went live in July 2020, and since then, it has been gaining traction in the blockchain space. The platform's native token, EGLD, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance. Elrond has established partnerships with various companies and projects, aiming to expand its ecosystem and drive adoption.\"\n\n**Use cases and applications:**\n\n\"Elrond's high throughput and low latency make it suitable for a wide range of applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the Internet of Things (IoT). Developers can build and deploy smart contracts using Elrond's Virtual Machine (VM), which supports multiple programming languages.\"\n\n**Unique selling points and limitations:**\n\n\"Elrond's Adaptive State Sharding and Secure Proof of Stake mechanisms provide a unique combination of scalability, security, and efficiency. However, as with any emerging technology, Elrond faces challenges related to adoption, interoperability with other blockchains, and ongoing development to enhance its features and performance.\"\n\n**Recent developments or updates:**\n\n\"Elrond continues to evolve, with recent updates focusing on improving network performance, expanding its ecosystem through partnerships, and enhancing developer tools to facilitate the creation of decentralized applications.\"\n\n### Source 2: \"Elrond (EGLD) Review: Next Level Blockchain Protocol?\" - https://coinbureau.com/review/elrond-egld/\n\n**Technical aspects, features, and architecture:**\n\n\"Elrond is a blockchain protocol that seeks to offer extremely fast transaction speeds by using sharding. The project describes itself as a technology ecosystem for the new internet, which includes fintech, decentralized finance, and the Internet of Things. Its smart contracts execution platform is reportedly capable of 15,000 transactions per second, six-second latency, and a transaction cost of $0.001.\"\n\n**Market positioning and adoption metrics:**\n\n\"Elrond's native token, EGLD, is used for paying network fees, staking, and rewarding validators. The project has been gaining attention for its high scalability and performance, positioning itself as a competitor to other high-throughput blockchains.\"\n\n**Use cases and applications:**\n\n\"Elrond's high throughput and low transaction fees make it suitable for a wide range of applications, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and enterprise solutions. The platform's support for multiple programming languages allows developers to build and deploy smart contracts efficiently.\"\n\n**Unique selling points and limitations:**\n\n\"Elrond's Adaptive State Sharding and Secure Proof of Stake mechanisms provide a unique combination of scalability, security, and efficiency. However, the project faces challenges related to adoption, competition from other high-performance blockchains, and the need to continuously improve and expand its ecosystem.\"\n\n**Recent developments or updates:**\n\n\"Elrond has been actively developing its ecosystem, with recent updates focusing on enhancing network performance, expanding partnerships, and providing better tools for developers to build decentralized applications.\"\n\n### Source 3: \"Elrond (EGLD): A Comprehensive Guide\" - https://cryptobriefing.com/elrond-egld-comprehensive-guide/\n\n**Technical aspects, features, and architecture:**\n\n\"Elrond is a blockchain platform that aims to provide high scalability, interoperability, and high throughput.
