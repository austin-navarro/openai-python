VeChainThor is a public blockchain that is designed for mass adoption and is intended to serve as a foundation for a sustainable and scalable blockchain ecosystem.\n\nSince it went live, the time when the genesis block was mined, in June 2018, the blockchain has been 100% online with zero downtime. VeChainThor is an extremely fast and efficient blockchain, producing blocks, on average, every 10 seconds and all the while only consuming a fraction of the energy other blockchains require to complete the same task. In fact, VeChain\u2019s energy consumption is equal to just 0.04% of other blockchains.\n\nThe VeChainThor blockchain is not built from scratch. It expands upon some of the essential building blocks of the Ethereum blockchain and provides innovative technical solutions that are powered by our novel governance and economic models, which, we believe, will push forward broader blockchain adoption and the creation of new business ecosystems with more efficiency and trust. VeChainThor is packed with technical features that are tailor-made to meet the needs of individuals and enterprises.\n\nVeChainThor's Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm is powered by 101 Authority Masternodes who are tasked with producing blocks for the VeChain blockchain. In order to become an Authority Masternode, an individual or entity has to voluntarily disclose their identity to the foundation and undergo a strict know-your-customer (KYC) process, before being selected. Only a block produced by an Authorithy Masternode will be viewed as a valid block by the VeChainThor blockchain.\n\nThere is a well known trade off in consensus algorithms which Vitalik Buterin, founder of the Ethereum blockchain, coined the \"The Blockchain Trilemma\". In essence, Buterin asserted peer-to-peer (P2P) decentralised networks cannot score highly on decentralisation, security and speed. Every blockchain network will be required to sacrifice one attribute to achieve the desired blockchain configuration. VeChain's aim is to be an enterprise grade, sustainable blockchain, and so the tradeoff was to reduce the amount of actors involved in block production in order to improve speed and security.\n\nHowever, as all Authority Masternodes have their identities and reputations at stake, they are all held accountable and are incentivised to work in the best interest for the networks growth and security. Authorithy Masternode's also earn rewards for producing blocks, which further incentivises them to act in good faith and to the benefit of the VeChainThor blockchain.\n\nVeChain continuously evolves the VeChainThor blockchain to meet emerging needs:\n\n- Regular protocol upgrades\n\n- Research into scaling solutions\n\n- Exploration of cross-chain interoperability\n\n- Ongoing security enhancements\n\nBy combining enterprise-grade performance with innovative features and a focus on sustainability, VeChainThor positions itself as a leading blockchain solution for businesses and individuals alike. Its unique consensus mechanism and tailored features provide a robust foundation for the next generation of blockchain applications and ecosystem growth.\n\n### Source 2: VeChain reaches 1M transactions per day with real use cases \u2013 Is it Walmart again? - https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/vechain-reaches-1m-transactions-per-day-with-real-use-cases-is-it-walmart-again/\n\nVeChain\u2019s consecutive growth is not stopping anytime soon, as network transactions hit 1 million.\n\nVeChain, the buzzing smart contract-compatible Blockchain has been recording massive growth in different areas. This comes not long after China\u2019s VeChain usage exploded in November.\n\nAfter the Walmart China branch partnered with the budding Blockchain network earlier on, usage from consumers on the platform reached a notable record high.\n\nMost recently, as the year comes to a close, transactions on the VeChain network have skyrocketed to a whopping 1 million.\n\nVeChain took to its official Twitter page to announce the new development in a tweet, in which it recognized the meteoric pace at which adoption is picking up.\n\n> \u201cWith another million+ transaction days of real-world economic activity in just the past few months, VET is reaching a tipping point.\u201d\n\nThe tweet also noted the need for more regulation, and how that would trigger mass adoption of the network.\n\n> \u201cRegulations & and adoption wave will make the VeChain blockchain go exponential.\u201d\n\n### Source 3: VeChain's Use Cases: How the VeChain Blockchain is Revolutionizing the Way We Track and Manage Products - https://chainaffairs.com/vechains-use-cases-how-the-vechain-blockchain-is-revolutionizing-the-way-we-track-and-manage-products/\n\nVeChain is a blockchain-based platform that is designed to provide solutions for supply chain management, product traceability, and authenticity verification. The platform uses a proof-of-authority consensus mechanism, which means that it is secured by a network of trusted nodes.\n\nVeChain\u2019s key goal is to enable better digital collaboration between businesses by giving them new tools for efficient data transfer and supply-chain management.\n\nVeChain has a number of potential use cases, including:\n\n- Supply chain management: VeChain can be used to track and trace products throughout the supply chain. This information can be used to improve efficiency, reduce fraud, and ensure product authenticity.\n\n- Product traceability: VeChain can be used to track and trace products from their origin to the point of sale. This information can be used to provide consumers with peace of mind and to help businesses comply with regulations.\n\n- Authenticity verification: VeChain can be used to verify the authenticity of products. This information can be used to protect consumers from counterfeit goods and to help businesses protect their brands.\n\n- Food safety: VeChain can be used to track and trace food products throughout the supply chain. This information can be used to ensure food safety and to help prevent foodborne illnesses.\n\n- Luxury goods: VeChain can be used to track and trace luxury goods throughout the supply chain. This information can be used to prevent counterfeiting and to help ensure the authenticity of luxury goods.\n\n- Logistics: VeChain can be used to track and trace shipments throughout the logistics process.
