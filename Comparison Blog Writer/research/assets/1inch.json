The beta went live in September, processing $573,000 in volume by quarter\u2019s end.\n\n- 1inch expanded its ecosystem reach with partnerships and integrations, including OKX Wallet, Nicegram, and Ramp Network, and launched the Triangle accelerator for the Telegram and TON ecosystem.\n\n- Despite a dip in overall market DEX volumes, 1inch saw significant engagement on its L2 deployments, with Arbitrum and Base contributing 24% of Aggregation Protocol volume.\n\n- Daily average volume on the Limit Order Protocol rose 2% QoQ, with Ethereum hosting 86% of the protocol\u2019s trading volume.\n\n**Fusion Mode**\n\n- Fusion mode routes volume through both the Aggregation Protocol and Limit Order Protocol. The daily average volume associated with Fusion was essentially flat QoQ, decreasing from $62.0 million to $61.8 million. The vast majority of volume (85% of all volume in Q3) occurred on Ethereum. Daily average volume on the Ethereum deployment increased by 1% QoQ from $52.2 million to $52.5 million. The biggest gainer in percentage terms was Polygon, which saw its daily average volume increase by 23% QoQ from $1.2 million to $1.6 million. All other notable deployments had a QoQ decrease in Fusion volume.\n\n- Resolvers are a key part of 1inch\u2019s Fusion mode, an intent-based DEX standard, as they execute the orders placed by users. In Q3, a new resolver, Flowmatic, went live and quickly cemented itself as one of the top resolvers on Fusion. Approximately 20% of all volume on Fusion was executed by Flowmatic. Rizzolver regained the top spot in Q3, accounting for 26% of the volume executed through Fusion. The remaining top four resolvers (1inch labs, Seawise, The T, and Artic Bastion) all lost volume share to Rizzolver and Flowmatic.\n\n- Despite volume remaining steady, orders through Fusion mode fell in Q3. Daily average orders decreased 18% QoQ from 5,800 to 4,800. Despite the overall decrease in orders, two deployments did see an increase: Ethereum (up 8% QoQ to 1,400) and Arbitrum (up 12% QoQ to 1,100). Combined, Ethereum and Arbitrum accounted for 53% of Fusion mode orders in Q3. All other deployments of Fusion mode had a QoQ decrease in orders this quarter.\n\n**Qualitative Analysis**\n\n**Triangle Accelerator Program**\n\n- In early July, it was announced that 1inch, Notcoin, and Sign partnered to launch Triangle, an accelerator program for the Telegram and TON ecosystem. Triangle aims to support builders and developers making consumer-focused apps on TON. Applications for the program closed on August 10, and selected projects will have a 6-week mentorship program. Furthermore, a curated group of venture capital firms and angel investors will provide access to capital.\n\n**Fusion+**\n\n- In early September, 1inch unveiled its whitepaper for Fusion+, a solution for cross-chain atomic swaps. It uses an intent-based model, where users submit trade intents that solvers can fulfill, rather than conducting instant transactions. The protocol employs a Dutch auction mechanism, in which the price gradually decreases until it becomes favorable enough for a solver to fulfill the trade. A critical component of Fusion+ is its use of Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs) to facilitate trustless and secure cross-chain transactions. HTLCs allow trades to be executed only when specific cryptographic conditions are met, such as revealing a pre-agreed hash within a set timeframe. If these conditions are not met, the assets are returned to their original owners, preventing loss due to incomplete transactions. Fusion+ also allows for partial fills, where solvers can complete a portion of the trade if full liquidity isn\u2019t immediately available. The 1inch DAO oversees parameters for the Fusion+ protocol, including settings like auction configurations, resolver participation rules, and minimum trade requirements.\n\n- On September 18, a beta version of Fusion+ went live, allowing some early users to test it. It is live on all chains currently supported by 1inch, and nearly $573,000 in volume was processed through it in September.\n\n**Integrations, Partnerships, & Upgrades**\n\n- The 1inch protocol has made significant strides in expanding its ecosystem and enhancing its utility through a series of strategic integrations, partnerships, and upgrades:\n\n  - Web3 RPC API (July 8) - 1inch Labs added the Web3 RPC API to 1inch Developer Portal, allowing project developers to easily integrate with 1inch.\n\n  - OKTAGON MMA Partnership (July 19) - 1inch and OKTAGON MMA entered the second stage of their partnership, expanding 1inch's support across ten major MMA events in Europe, aiming to connect with broader audiences.\n\n  - 1inch Wallet Update (July 26) - 1inch Wallet V2.5.0 was released, with token import updates, a refreshed receive screen, and enhanced scam protection.\n\n  - Explore Feature Added on 1inch Portfolio (July 30) - The 1inch Portfolio has introduced the \"Explore\" feature, allowing users to compare yields, analyze top-performing DeFi assets, and view personalized investment opportunities.\n\n  - Ramp Network Integration (August 15) - Allows 1inch Wallet users to easily convert fiat to crypto through Apple Pay, bank transfers, and more.\n\n  - 1inch Wallet Update (Aug 16) - 1inch Wallet V2.6.0 was released, with a better WalletConnect integration, updated News section, and an improved Send flow.\n\n  - Nicegram Integration (Aug 20) - Telegram-based wallet Nicegram integrated with 1inch to quickly trade tokens on supported EVM blockchains.\n\n  - OKX Wallet Partnership (Sep 16) - 1inch and OKX have partnered to integrate 1inch's Swap and Fusion APIs into OKX Wallet and OKX DEX, enhancing users' swapping experiences with optimal rates, deeper liquidity, and advanced security features.\n\n**Closing Summary**\n\n- In Q3, 1inch ",
