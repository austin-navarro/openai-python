A Guide to the Gateway of Decentralized Finance - https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-yearn-a-guide-to-the-gateway-of-decentralized-finance\n\nYearn.Finance, launched in early 2020 by founder Andre Cronje, is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It functions as a smart contract protocol that aggregates offerings from various DeFi protocols such as Aave, Curve, and Compound. This aggregation enables investors to find the highest yields available in the market by automatically moving funds to optimize returns, a process known as \"profit switching.\" The yields are derived from multiple sources, including gas fees, trading fees, staking rewards, and lending interests.\n\nUsers can interact with Yearn.Finance by connecting their cryptocurrency wallets\u2014options include MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Ledger, and Trezor\u2014to the protocol. Deposits can be made through various blockchains integrated into the platform, such as Ethereum, Fantom, and Arbitrum. Once funds are deposited, users can earn yields by selecting different lending pools and strategies, referred to as vaults. These vaults allow users to hold assets while simultaneously earning yields denominated in those assets. For example, holders of SUSHI tokens can deposit them into a vault, and Yearn will utilize these holdings to generate additional SUSHI tokens. The process involves Yearn borrowing stablecoins against the deposited asset, which are then used to seek yield-farming opportunities, with constant rebalancing as market conditions change.\n\nThe native governance token of the Yearn platform is YFI. Upon its launch in July 2020, all YFI tokens were distributed to users with deposits in specific liquidity pools that benefited the project, with no tokens set aside for the creator or the company. Initially, the circulating supply was capped at 30,000 YFI, with an additional 6,666 tokens added later. Holders of YFI can propose and vote on changes to the platform by staking their tokens, which are locked for three days during the voting process. Participants earn a small fee for their involvement in governance decisions.\n\nIn April 2022, Yearn endorsed the ERC-4626 standard, which streamlines the design for yield-bearing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. This standardization allows developers to build upon a shared interface for tokens held in vaults, facilitating easier passage between protocols and unlocking innovation in decentralized finance.\n\nYearn has also engaged in partnerships and mergers with other DeFi projects, including Pickle Finance, Hegic, Cream, and Akropolis, aiming to expand its offerings and become a powerhouse for yield farming. However, the platform has faced challenges, such as a security exploit in February 2021 that resulted in an $11 million loss from its DAI lending pool, with the attacker absconding with $2.8 million.\n\n### Source 2: YearnV3: Motivation and design - https://medium.com/iearn/yearnv3-motivation-and-design-107840cb4844\n\nYearn.Finance is developing YearnV3, an iteration of its vault system aimed at increasing robustness and advancing decentralization. The primary objectives of YearnV3 include enhancing security, reducing the effort required to write new strategies, accommodating a wider range of strategies (including those that lock funds or are potentially lossy but expected to be profitable in the long term), enabling multi-chain liquidity and strategies, achieving immutability without migrations, decentralizing strategy whitelisting, and automating or decentralizing debt allocation.\n\nTo achieve these goals, YearnV3 introduces a modularized architecture consisting of three main components: Robust Core, Smart Modules, and Periphery.\n\n- **Robust Core**: This component handles essential functions that a vault must perform reliably, such as deposits and withdrawals, accounting, fund management, and access control. By focusing on these critical tasks, the core can be made immutable and highly secure.\n\n- **Smart Modules**: These modules implement complex logic that is expected to evolve over time. They include the Debt Allocator (which determines the maximum debt a vault can allocate to a strategy), Strategy Registry (manages the addition and removal of strategies), Fee Manager (implements vault fee assessment logic), and HealthCheck (sets guardrails for vault operations to ensure acceptable profit and loss reporting). Initially, these modules will replicate the functionality of V2 vaults, with future iterations focusing on decentralization and automation.\n\n- **Periphery**: This layer includes optional functions that facilitate the creation of user interfaces, tools, or other protocols on top of Yearn. Components such as yRouter (handles deposits and withdrawals), Yearn Lens (aggregates information for off-chain applications), APY TWAP Oracle (provides reliable sources of vault performance), and ySwaps (an internal swap system to reduce slippage and improve net APY) are part of this layer.\n\nA significant change in YearnV3 is the redefined relationship between strategies and vaults. Strategies will have reduced responsibilities and a simplified interface, allowing for a wider range of strategies, including those that lock funds or are expected to earn in the long term but may incur short-term losses. Strategies can now be created permissionlessly and proposed to YFI or yvToken holders for endorsement, promoting decentralization and innovation within the Yearn ecosystem.\n\n### Source 3: Exploring the Key Features of Yearn.Finance for Investors - https://thecryptocortex.com/key-features-of-yearn-finance/\n\nYearn.Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that automates the process of allocating users' funds across various DeFi protocols to optimize yield farming strategies. By leveraging smart contracts, users can deposit assets and access a range of yield-optimizing strategies without the need for constant monitoring or manual intervention.\n\nThe platform employs strategic yield optimization through sophisticated algorithms that continuously assess various yield farming opportunities across DeFi platforms. This automated assessment analyzes yield rates from multiple sources and directs funds to the most lucrative options, ensuring maximum profit potential. Key components of this strategy include research on yield rates, adaptability to market conditions, and active fund allocation.\n\n ",
