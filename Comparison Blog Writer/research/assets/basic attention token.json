How It Tracks Consumers - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basic-attention-token.asp\n\n**What Is a Basic Attention Token (BAT)?**\n\nThe Basic Attention Token (BAT) was created by the co-founder of Mozilla and Firefox, Brendan Eich, to improve the security, fairness, and efficiency of digital advertising through blockchain technology. It is the native token of the Brave web browser built on top of Ethereum (ETH). BAT's white paper is dated Feb. 10, 2021. As of 2022, the project is still being developed, although the Brave browser is available for download. There were 57.3 million monthly active users and 22.1 million daily users of the Brave browser as of May 31, 2023.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n- The Basic Attention Token (BAT) is a blockchain-based system for tracking media consumers' time and attention on websites using the Brave web browser.\n- Built on Ethereum, its goal is to efficiently distribute advertising money between advertisers, publishers, and readers of online marketing content and ads.\n- The objective is for readers to experience fewer ads that are more well-tailored to their interests while at the same time not giving up their data privacy rights.\n\n**Understanding the Basic Attention Token**\n\nThe Basic Attention Token (BAT) utilizes the Ethereum blockchain and a specialized web browser known as Brave.
