The blockchain is developed on the Cosmos SDK and utilizes BFT Tendermint consensus engine. Native assets are managed directly in onchain vaults and funds are secured by node\u2019s bonding or staking RUNE.\n\nThe network employs Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS) requiring a two-thirds majority of nodes for the movement of funds to and from vaults. Each vault must have a RUNE stake worth more than 1.5 times the value of the vault's funds to ensure they do not collude to steal funds.\n\nTHORChain uses continuous liquidity pools (CLP) where all pools are paired with RUNE and provide consistent liquidity to all assets in the network. Furthermore, fees are adjusted according to the liquidity depth of the pool. Additionally, THORChain provides a Savings Product for yield on synthetic assets (synths) and a Lending Product for overcollateralized, 0% interest loans with no liquidations or expiration.\n\nOn July 31, 2024, THORChain launched RUNEPool. RUNEPool enables RUNE holders to provide liquidity across various pools, offering yield generation on RUNE via exposure to multiple blue-chip assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC.\n\nTHORChain affiliates earned a total of $3.2 million in revenue in Q3, an 18.4% decrease from the $3.9 million earned in Q2.\n\nTHORSwap remained the largest affiliate by total volume in Q3, with a total of $678 million in volume.\n\nTHORChain DeFi TVL in RUNE increased from 66 million RUNE to 74 million RUNE, a 12.4% rise QoQ, despite a 19.3% drop in USD-based TVL to $297.3 million.\n\nRUNE price increased 29.3% QoQ to $5.36, significantly outperforming the greater crypto market which decreased by 2.8%.\n\nTHORChain underwent a successful hard fork on Sept. 4, 2024. The hard fork upgraded the Cosmos SDK version and removed unnecessary Cosmos modules and other obsolete legacy code.\n\nADR-17 was passed and implemented in Q3, creating a RUNE burn mechanism from system income.\n\nTHORChain added support for Bitcoin Taproot addresses as part of the aforementioned hard fork.\n\n### Source 2: THORChain Q4 2024 Brief - https://messari.io/report/thorchain-q4-2024-brief\n\nThe launch of THORChain V3 on Dec. 21, 2024, represents a major milestone in the platform's development. It introduced a RUNE token burn mechanism and upgraded to Cosmos SDK v50 and CometBFT consensus.\n\nTHORChain average daily volume rose significantly in Q4 from $62.1 million to $91.0 million, a 46.6% rise QoQ.\n\nTHORChain affiliate revenue also rose from $3.2 million in Q3 to $11.4 million in Q4, a sizable 256.3% increase.\n\nAfter a strong Q3 THORChain\u2019s RUNE token cooled off slightly in Q4 finishing the quarter at a market cap of $1.5 billion, a 10.2% decrease QoQ.\n\nDespite RUNE having a down quarter, THORChain DeFi TVL performed well, finishing the quarter up 19.4% from $308.6 million to $368.6 million QoQ after peaking at $455.8 million on Dec. 7, 2024.\n\nThe V3 upgrade addresses core architectural limitations, introduces new economic mechanisms, and expands developer tooling, positioning THORChain as a leader in cross-chain liquidity solutions.\n\nOne of the standout features of the V3 upgrade is the introduction of a deflationary economic model for the RUNE token. The updated model incorporates a RUNE burn mechanism, which reduces token supply over time, thereby potentially increasing scarcity and supporting long-term price stability. 5.0% of the system income is burned in each block and is deducted from the total RUNE token supply.\n\nThe Incentive Pendulum, a system that balances liquidity distribution between pools and network security, has been refined. The pendulum mechanism ensures that RUNE staked for security and liquidity is optimally balanced, reducing inefficiencies and incentivizing user participation in both roles.\n\nA cornerstone of the V3 release is THORChain's upgrade to Cosmos SDK v0.50 and its transition to the CometBFT consensus algorithm. The Cosmos SDK upgrade enhances interoperability, aligning THORChain with the broader Cosmos ecosystem and enabling seamless integration with other IBC-enabled blockchains. In addition, the integration of the CosmWasm module and the enabling of smart contract functionality enables further development.\n\nThe shift from Tendermint to CometBFT introduces significant improvements in performance, scalability, and security. CometBFT offers faster block finality, allowing THORChain to process transactions more efficiently.\n\nThe App Layer, introduced in V3, represents a significant addition to THORChain's architecture. This layer provides developers with the tools to build dApps directly on THORChain's liquidity network. By enabling native integration of dApps, the App Layer creates an environment where developers can leverage the protocol's liquidity pools to deploy advanced financial applications.\n\nThe collaborative nature of this development is notable, as it incorporates contributions from the Rujira Alliance, a collective of DeFi projects. The App Layer supports a variety of use cases, including order books, perpetual futures, NFTs, launchpads, and liquidation platforms.\n\n### Source 3: THORChain V3 Release. A Paradigm Shift in Decentralised\u2026 - https://medium.com/thorchain/thorchain-v3-release-659b700d7099\n\nWith the release of v3, THORChain has undergone transformative upgrades that redefine its capabilities and potential.\n\nThis update aligns THORChain with the latest advancements in the Cosmos ecosystem. The addition of smart contract functionality, including support for the CosmWasm module, enables developers to deploy smart contracts directly onto TH ",
