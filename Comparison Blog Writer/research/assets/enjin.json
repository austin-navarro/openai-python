It supports over 5,000 transactions per second, allows for 2,200 mints per transaction, and has a block time of 6 seconds. The blockchain is a Proof-of-Stake dual-layer chain with NFT-specific functions integrated at the protocol level. Key features include seamless end-to-end app integration, low transaction fees, advanced NFT functions, and sustainability through its Substrate architecture. The Enjin Blockchain comprises several components:\n\n- **Enjin Relaychain**: The foundation and security layer of the Enjin Blockchain.\n\n- **Enjin Matrixchain**: The NFT application layer, secured by the Enjin Relaychain.\n\n- **Custom Matrixchains**: Interoperable, purpose-built chains secured by the Enjin Relaychain.\n\nThe Enjin Matrixchain is optimized for mainstream games, featuring managed wallets, fuel tanks to cover transaction fees, on-chain metadata, an on-chain marketplace, guaranteed royalties for creators, and an open-source platform for easy integration. Governance and staking are facilitated through a nominated proof-of-stake consensus model, allowing ENJ holders to stake their tokens, contribute to network security, and earn governance rewards.\n\n### Source 2: Enjin Coin - The Cryptocurrency for Blockchain Assets - https://docs.enjin.io/docs/enjin-coin\n\nEnjin Coin (ENJ) is the native coin of the Enjin Blockchain, playing a vital role in facilitating transactions on the network. It serves as the primary currency for paying transaction fees and as the voting mechanism for network governance, consensus, and block nomination through ENJ staking. The Enjin Blockchain employs a decentralized governance model fully controlled by ENJ holders, independent of the Enjin company. Starting July 1st, 2023, the Enjin Blockchain launched with full governance support and without super-user (SUDO) access, ensuring decentralized, transparent, and fair governance. ENJ also serves as a medium of exchange within the ecosystem and rewards active community participation. The Enjin Blockchain is fully integrated with Enjin products such as the Enjin Wallet, NFT Marketplace, and Platform SDKs, providing a seamless end-to-end user experience. The network's security is ensured by a nominated proof-of-stake staking mechanism deployed on the Relay Chain, with rewards compliant with SEC regulations. Staking ENJ is facilitated through an intuitive user interface directly from the Enjin Wallet, allowing users to allocate their ENJ to curated nomination pools with just one click.\n\n### Source 3: Enjin Platform - Build and Manage Blockchain Assets - https://docs.enjin.io/docs/enjin-platform\n\nThe Enjin Platform is an open-source framework for building NFT platforms and integrations, allowing developers to easily communicate with the Enjin Blockchain. It acts as a bridge between blockchain and user-friendly applications, minimizing technical barriers through a lightweight, modular layer that uses a modern, flexible GraphQL API. Key components include:\n\n- **Enjin API**: A GraphQL API providing a server-based interface for executing queries and mutations, enabling easy retrieval of information or execution of transactions on the blockchain.\n\n- **Events**: Allows developers to subscribe to events and receive real-time updates on on-chain activities, eliminating the need for constant API polling.\n\n- **Wallet Daemon**: Automatically signs and broadcasts transactions to the Enjin Blockchain, running on a secure server to remove the need for manual signing.\n\n- **SDKs**: Enjin provides multiple SDKs, including an open-source C# SDK, to streamline integration into various projects.\n\nThe platform offers features like a quick sync method for fetching the most recent blockchain state, an auto-healing feature for database health monitoring, and an auto-teleport function for seamless ENJ transfers between the Relaychain and Matrixchain. The Enjin Platform Cloud provides a user-friendly version for rapid NFT project integration, running on Enjin's robust servers while ensuring security and isolation for each project instance. ",
