This remarkable growth was fueled by innovative protocols and a perceived shift toward pro-crypto policies following Donald Trump\u2019s reelection as U.S. President in November. The victory triggered a rally in DeFi tokens, with many appreciating by up to 30% in the immediate aftermath.\n\n**Expanding Horizons in 2024**\n\nAave significantly broadened its footprint in 2024 by integrating with major blockchain networks, including BNB Chain, ZKsync Era, Scroll, and Ether.fi. These integrations brought new markets to the protocol, contributing an additional $2.55 billion to its ecosystem.\n\nIn a bid to maintain its momentum, Aave introduced the much-anticipated V4 update. The upgrade emphasized modularity, reduced governance overhead, enhanced capital efficiency, and liquidity innovations.\n\nAdditionally, the launch of GHO, Aave\u2019s decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin, marked another strategic milestone. GHO debuted on Arbitrum and is set to expand to Base and Avalanche in the coming months, further strengthening Aave\u2019s cross-chain presence.\n\n**Ambitious Goals for 2025**\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, Aave plans to capitalize on its recent successes. Community proposals for the coming year include potential integrations with Sonic, Mantle, Linea, Spider Chain, and Aptos, promising to add six new blockchain networks to its ecosystem.\n\n**Security and Stability Drive Confidence**\n\nOne of the standout achievements for the DeFi sector in 2024 was the significant improvement in security. Data from blockchain security firm Hacken revealed a 40% reduction in hacks compared to 2023, thanks to advancements in cryptography, protocol updates, and enhanced bridge designs.\n\nThis contrasts sharply with the centralized exchange (CEX) sector, where breaches resulted in losses exceeding $694 million\u2014almost double the previous year.\n\n### Source 2: Aave\u2019s Proposal for V4 Introduces Cross-Chain Liquidity Layer \u2013 https://support.bitrue.com/hc/en-001/articles/31960704929177-Aave-s-Proposal-for-V4-Introduces-Cross-Chain-Liquidity-Layer\n\nAave, the largest DeFi lending protocol by TVL, has proposed plans to launch a v4 iteration within the next three years. Announced on May 1, Aave v4 will boast a unified cross-chain liquidity layer (CCLL), aggregating liquidity from across multiple networks within a single protocol. Aave noted that CCLL would be powered by Chainlink\u2019s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which completed its permissionless rollout last week.\n\nAave v4 will also feature automated adjustments to its interest rate curve, dynamic interest rate premiums for riskier assets, smart accounts and vaults allowing users to segregate their borrowing activities, and an updated liquidation engine. Aave said it hopes to begin prototyping its v4 protocol during Q4 and hopes to implement the code in Q2 2025. However, it does not expect the CCLL to roll out until 2026 or 2027.\n\nThe proposal also outlines plans to launch an Aave Network, which would function as the primary hub for the Aave protocol and the project\u2019s GHO stablecoin. Aave is also considering utilizing a rollup-like Validium architecture for the network, adopting GHO as its network token for fees, and using AAVE as the main staking asset for decentralized validators and sequencers. Aave noted it will monitor the evolution of both Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks before finalizing the network\u2019s architecture, but said Aave Network will inherit its security from Ethereum.\n\n**Aave\u2019s Plan for Ensuring Future Market Dominance**\n\nAccording to The Defiant, recent research from Token Terminal indicated that Aave has consistently enjoyed a roughly 50% share of the DeFi lending market over the past three years. Aave\u2019s Marc Zeller replied that roughly 75% of the value in DeFi lending protocols is locked in projects leveraging versions of Aave\u2019s codebase.\n\nAave said its three-year plan seeks to maintain its position as a leading DeFi for the rest of the decade. Aave\u2019s three-year roadmap also includes promoting the development of real-world asset products built around GHO, expanding Aave onto networks that do not support Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contracts, and introducing new visual branding licensed to the Aave DAO.\n\nAave is budgeting 15M GHO and 25,000 stkAAVE ($2.1 million) to complete the first year of the roadmap, with the DAO providing 3M GHO upfront and streaming the remaining assets over the first 12 months.\n\n### Source 3: Aave Dominates DeFi With $20B In Deposits And 67% Market Share In Lending - A New Era Of Growth - https://chainaffairs.com/aave-dominates-defi-with-20b-in-deposits-and-67-market-share-in-lending-a-new-era-of-growth/\n\nAave (AAVE), one of the most dominant decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, continues to solidify its market leadership by reaching an all-time high in token holders and accumulating nearly $20 billion in user deposits. As the DeFi landscape grows more complex, Aave remains resilient, offering investors some of the best opportunities in the crypto space, despite facing challenges like the Terra Luna and Celsius crashes.\n\n**Aave\u2019s Comprehensive DeFi Platform**\n\nA ",
