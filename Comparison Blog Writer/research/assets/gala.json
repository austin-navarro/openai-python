Built on Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) and powered by a network of Founder\u2019s Nodes, GalaChain offers impressive speed, security, and scalability. The GALA token serves as the foundational utility token within the Gala ecosystem, emitted daily to active Founder\u2019s Node operators. Following the successful implementation of GalaChain for Gala\u2019s core entertainment brands, a publicly available SDK and creators toolkit opened in early 2024, extending GalaChain development to creators and innovators from industries beyond entertainment.\n\nGalaChain is designed to robustly support the demands of Web2 gaming while adding Web3 functions such as ownership and rewards, extending its capabilities to other industries. The design philosophy behind GalaChain is simple yet ambitious: if it can seamlessly handle the intensive requirements of gaming, it can accommodate virtually any application or industry need. This approach positions GalaChain as a distinctly scalable blockchain solution with a head start on the tech demands of multiple industries.\n\nGala was founded in 2018 by Eric Schiermeyer, co-founder of Zynga and a pioneering innovator of the social gaming genre. The founding team included creators of social gaming hits like Farmville 2, Words with Friends, and Zynga Poker. Gala\u2019s partnerships span a diverse array of reputable entities within the gaming and entertainment industries, including DreamWorks Animation, AMC Networks, and NBCUniversal. Additionally, Gala has collaborated with iconic game developers such as Peter Molyneux and Will Wright, and music industry giants like Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Brray, and Kings of Leon.\n\nGalaChain is built on Hyperledger Fabric (HLF), providing a modular architecture with interchangeable components such as consensus and membership services. This plug-and-play environment ensures that GalaChain can be customized to meet the specific needs of the Gala ecosystem. Hyperledger Fabric, initiated by the Linux Foundation in 2015, promotes the development of cross-industry blockchain technologies through a collaborative, community-driven approach.\n\nOne of the key features of Hyperledger Fabric is its private and permissioned nature, making it ideal for enterprise use. Companies like Honeywell, Walmart, and Bosch leverage HLF for their secure, scalable, and customizable private blockchains. For GalaChain, this means a stable and adaptable chain that supports the various components of Gala\u2019s entertainment ecosystem.\n\nGalaChain uses deterministic consensus algorithms with a specific type of node called an orderer, part of an ordering service. This asynchronous and multi-step process ensures that any block validated by a peer is final and accurate, eliminating the risk of ledger forks. By separating chaincode execution from the ordering process, GalaChain avoids bottlenecks, enhancing performance and scalability. The blockchain is designed to integrate smoothly with both Gala\u2019s platform and the Gala Node Network.\n\nThe Founder\u2019s Node Ecosystem is another cornerstone of GalaChain\u2019s architecture. Limited to just 50,000 nodes, these operators are crucial in providing players with true ownership of their assets and content. By running a Founder\u2019s Node, operators help maintain a decentralized infrastructure that supports complex, decentralized tasks tailored to specific project needs. Daily distribution from these Founder\u2019s Nodes is the only way GALA originates.\n\nAlongside Founder\u2019s Nodes, many projects throughout the Gala Ecosystem are running individual Nodes with specialized workloads. The Gala Node Network supports custom-built tasks and provides a unique approach to project monetization, bypassing the complexities of traditional ICOs and reducing central costs. Their effectiveness is proven, serving as the backbone for existing applications and top-tier games.\n\nDeveloped by experts who have built some of the largest gaming networks globally, these nodes offer unparalleled experience and scalability. This allows projects to expand their node network as needed, potentially eliminating the need for datacenter and cloud hosting expenses.\n\nThe scope of Founder\u2019s Nodes operations is set to expand significantly in the near future. They are expected to take on critical responsibilities in bridge transactions and chain security, among other key functions. Their versatility and capacity to adapt to various roles ensure the robustness and agility of the ecosystem, making it well-equipped to meet both current and future challenges.\n\nGalaChain is designed to be environmentally conscious, consuming significantly less energy than other blockchain platforms while offering superior computational capabilities. This approach ensures that GalaChain remains sustainable and efficient, aligning with global efforts to reduce energy consumption in technology.\n\nGalaChain is highly developer-centric, providing extensive resources to make the platform more accessible and easier to use. Contracts and tokens can be efficiently created using TypeScript, which reduces onboarding friction for developers not familiar with specialized languages like Solidity. Developers on GalaChain have easy access to an open-source SDK with custom chaincode templates, simplifying the development process. Additionally, the ultra-simplified Gala Creator Portal allows innovators and developers to easily bring their visions to life on the Gala Platform, creating even more possibilities that they can create on chain.\n\nAs the cornerstone of the GalaChain ecosystem, Gala Games boasts a portfolio of 17 games, including 6 in early access and 3 coming soon. These games support various platforms such as browser, mobile (Android and iOS), Windows, and Mac.\n\nCurrently, 12 of these games have been onboarded on GalaChain, including Champions Arena, Legacy, and The Walking Dead: Empires, leveraging its robust infrastructure to provide seamless and enhanced gaming experiences. The titles curated by Gala have recently been joined by Voyager: Ascension \u2013 the first third-party published game to onboard onto Gala\u2019s platform. The integration of GalaChain ensures improved performance, lower transaction costs, and greater security, making it a vital component of Gala Games\u2019 ongoing success and expansion.\n\nGala Music is a decentralized music streaming platform powered by GalaChain and IPFS.
