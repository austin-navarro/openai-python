HBAR powers decentralized applications (DApps), supports smart contracts, and helps secure the network. Unlike most blockchains, Hedera doesn\u2019t use Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). Instead, it uses an energy-efficient system called Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) through the Hashgraph Consensus Algorithm.\n\n**Key Features of Hedera Hashgraph**\n\n- **Energy Efficiency**: Hedera uses far less energy than traditional systems like Bitcoin, making it environmentally friendly. It can process thousands of transactions per second without needing massive computational power.\n\n- **Fair Transaction Ordering**: Transactions are processed based on the time they arrive, ensuring fairness. Every transaction is time-stamped and handled in the correct sequence.\n\n- **Finality**: Once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be changed. This ensures trust and reliability for all network participants.\n\n- **Governance**: Hedera is governed by the Hedera Governing Council, an assembly of globally recognized organizations, which includes major companies like Google, IBM, and Boeing. These organizations run network nodes and ensure decentralized trust. The council ensures that decisions about the network\u2019s future are transparent and fair, and no single entity has full control.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\n- **Developer Playground (Jan 23, 2025)**: A browser tool for developers to write, test, and share code easily, making it more accessible for people new to the network.\n\n- **HIP-423 Scheduled Transactions (Jan 21, 2025)**: A system improvement to help enterprises and developers manage transactions better by scheduling them in advance.\n\n- **Decentralized Link-in-Bio (Jan 17, 2025)**: \u201cLinkPages\u201d offers a decentralized alternative to platforms like LinkTree, giving users full ownership of their content.\n\n- **AI Society Membership (Jan 15, 2025)**: Hedera joined the Decentralized AI Society to support ethical AI adoption and integrate blockchain with AI technology.\n\n- **Block Streams (Dec 27, 2024)**: A new data tool that merges event and transaction information, making it easier for developers to work with data on Hedera.\n\n- **HederaCon 2025 (Feb 25, 2025)**: Hedera\u2019s first user conference in Denver, Colorado, aimed at growing the community and encouraging collaboration.\n\n- **Leadership Changes (Dec 20, 2024)**: Charles Adkins will lead the new HBAR Foundation starting in 2025, focusing on supporting projects that use the Hedera network.\n\n**Token Overview**\n\n- **Total Supply**: 50 billion\n\n- **In Circulation**: Approximately 38.27 billion (~76.5%)\n\n- **Market Cap**: ~$12.2 billion\n\n- **Price (Jan 24, 2025)**: $0.3195\n\n- **Fully Diluted Valuation**: ~$16 billion\n\nHedera implements a heavy token release strategy. For example, on January 1, 2025, 3.84 billion HBAR tokens were unlocked, representing 7.67% of the total supply.\n\n**Partnerships and Use Cases**\n\n- **SpaceX Collaboration**: Testing blockchain transactions in space to demonstrate Hedera\u2019s technology in extreme environments.\n\n- **Philippine Banks**: Creating the PHPX stablecoin, showing real-world adoption and solving local payment challenges.\n\n- **Tech Giants Involvement**: Companies like NVIDIA and Intel are exploring Hedera for AI and blockchain projects, merging cutting-edge tech with decentralized systems.\n\n### Source 2: Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) explained: A beginner\u2019s guide - https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/hedera-hashgraph-hbar\n\n**Use cases and applications of Hedera**\n\nHedera Hashgraph\u2019s fast, secure, and energy-efficient platform has enticed companies from various industries to develop scalable and innovative solutions. Its adaptability enables applications ranging from finance to gaming, making it a cornerstone of Web3 advancement.\n\n**Payments**\n\nHedera supports quick, low-cost, and transparent payments, which help make financial services more efficient. For example, on Feb. 24, 2021, Standard Bank Group, the largest African bank by assets, partnered with Hedera to set up the continent\u2019s first Hedera network node and resolve some sore points that troubled enterprises in cross-border trade. These problems included long settlement periods and information asymmetry between the parties involved.\n\n**Asset tokenization**\n\nHedera facilitates asset tokenization by enabling you to create, manage, and trade digital representations of real-world assets (RWAs). Key features of Hedera, such as quick transaction times and negligible fees, make the platform conducive to tokenizing assets such as real estate, art, and commodities. The platform supports the creation of various digital assets, ranging from regulated securities to NFTs, enhancing the assets\u2019 liquidity and allowing for fractional ownership.\n\nTo ensure compliance, you may require account-level configurations when tokenizing assets. Hedera empowers token issuers to implement crucial features such as:\n\n- **Know Your Customer (KYC) verification**: Establish and enforce KYC requirements at the account level.\n\n- **Account freezing**: Enable the freezing of accounts to prevent unauthorized transactions.\n\n- **Token supply management**: Control token issuance, circulation, and distribution.\n\n- **Transfer restrictions** ",
