This model allows liquidity providers to offer assets within specific price ranges, enhancing capital efficiency and providing deeper liquidity for traders.\n\nPancakeSwap v4, recognizing the need for adaptability and scalability, separates Accounting logic from AMM logic, implements a three-tiered modular architecture (see image below) that consists of the Vault, Pool Managers, and Hooks. This allows for easier integration of evolving AMM paradigms without requiring a complete protocol overhaul.\n\nIn contrast to v3's limited flexibility, PancakeSwap v4 takes a more open-ended approach, empowering pool creators with greater customization capabilities. The introduction of hooks enables the integration of custom features like bespoke oracles, dynamic fee components, active liquidity management strategies, diverse order types, and more. The non-upgradeable core ensures stability, while each pool can integrate its own hook smart contract at creation.\n\nAdditionally, each AMM implementation/Pool Type has an independent Singleton implementation, optimizing gas efficiency for new pool deployment and multi-hop transactions.\n\nFlash Accounting complements the Singleton contract design by consolidating transaction settlement, computing net balances for a batch of transactions, and settling them collectively, reducing gas consumption.\n\n### Source 2: PancakeSwap achieves $310 billion in 2024 trading volume, marking a 179% growth - https://goonus.io/en/insights/pancakeswap-achieves-310-billion-in-2024-trading-volume-marking-a-179-growth\n\nIn 2024, PancakeSwap\u2019s trading volume reached 310 billion USD, up from 111 billion USD in 2023, showing a remarkable growth spurred by decentralized finance and layer-2 solutions.\n\nImprovements like PancakeSwapX and a Telegram Swap bot contributed to the increase, aiding PancakeSwap to secure its position as the second-largest decentralized exchange, with daily volumes at 2.23 billion USD.\n\n### Source 3: PancakeSwap Reports $836 Billion Trading Volume And Plans Major Update | Binance News on Binance Square - https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/2024-09-20-pancakeswap-reports-836-billion-trading-volume-and-plans-major-update-13790948084466\n\nAccording to Cointelegraph, decentralized exchange PancakeSwap has reported a cumulative trading volume of $836 billion and a total value locked (TVL) of approximately $1.72 billion over its four years of operation. As of September 20, PancakeSwap's TVL stood at $1.72 billion, a significant decrease from its all-time high of $7.16 billion on May 4, 2021, as per DefiLlama. The TVL was about $2.42 billion on March 30 and has been declining since then.\n\nThe exchange, which operates on an automated market maker (AMM) model, serves over 43 million cumulative unique addresses. PancakeSwap has announced the upcoming release of PancakeSwap v4, a major update aimed at enhancing user experience and scalability. The update is expected to address shortcomings in existing AMMs, such as inflexible pricing models, limited trading features compared to centralized exchanges, impermanent loss for liquidity providers, and high on-chain gas fees. Chef Kids, head of PancakeSwap, stated that the new version would offer dynamic fee tiers, advanced trading tools, and reduced gas fees, thereby improving the overall trading experience and lowering costs.\n\nPancakeSwap has also released its v4 white paper this year and launched a $500,000 developer program to attract top-tier builders ahead of the official v4 launch. As part of this initiative, PancakeSwap is hosting a v4 Hookathon on Dorahacks, with submissions open until September 30. Launched in 2020, PancakeSwap is available across nine chains, including BNB Chain, Ethereum, Aptos, Polygon zkEVM, ZKsync Era, Arbitrum One, Linea, Base, and opBNB.\n\nChef Kids mentioned that PancakeSwap plans to expand its decentralized exchange to more chains. By focusing on product-market fit, PancakeSwap aims to address the lack of functionality and user experience in many DEXs. Improving accessibility and trading efficiency on emerging networks could help PancakeSwap fill a crucial market gap. ",
